This list is not conclusive, and we regularly improve and update it with new cases. If you don\u2019t find the answer you\u2019re looking for here, submit your request to our support team , we\u2019ll be happy to help you. Troubleshoot Password, Email Address, and Login Problems \u00b6 Did you not receive new account invitation email? To register with Corefy, you need to give the account manager the existing e-mail address to send the invitation. Firstly, if you cannot find the e-mail, check the Spam folder. Contact the account administrator to verify that the address is correct and ask about resending the invitation. If the email is still missing, you might need to use another e-mail address. Do you forget the password or the existing password doesn\u2019t fit? Use the password recovery button: enter an e-mail and request a link to change the password. If the email does not arrive, check the Spam folder. On the off chance, contact your account administrator to ensure that you have all the necessary access and activated user profile. Have you enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) but forgot the connected mobile device? If you enabled Two-Factor Authentication, you need to enter the secret code to access the application. But what if you don't have your mobile device to get that code? There are several steps you can take. If you use the Authy app, download the desktop version to your laptop or desktop computer. You can then get the authentication code on your computer and use that code to log in. Also, you can change the mobile phone number with Authy and have the authentication code sent to a different mobile phone number. If you have saved list with one-time 10-digits codes to restore access, enter one of them in the field for two-factor authentication. Contact Corefy support to disable two-factor authentication on your profile, so you can log in with a password only. But after that, don't forget to return 2FA with the right device. Does your authentication fail several times? If your authentication fails several times, you may need to synchronize your phone's clock with your mobile provider. Often, this involves checking the \"Set automatically\" option on your phone's clock, rather than providing your time zone. Code not working? Make sure you are not entering spaces between the numbers from the Authy app. Use your saved list with one-time 10-digits codes to restore access and enter one of them in the field for two-factor authentication. Contact Corefy support to disable two-factor authentication on your profile, so you can log in with a password only. But after that, don't forget to return 2FA with the right device. Troubleshoot Dashboard Errors \u00b6 The 403 forbidden error There are two probable causes for error 403 when passing between pages: the active user session ended on your device: refresh the page to re-login and continue working; check if you have permission to access this section: contact the account administrator to clarify the situation. What timezone is used for transactions' date and time? You can customize transactions' date and time in the dashboard. Configure the time zone in the user profile but consider this option if you have team members from different time zones. When you exchange information about transactions in the process, use unique payment ID, not date and time only. API Integration \u00b6 What is the REST based API? What is the input and output data format for request and response? Our API has been designed as a REST API. It uses the HTTP protocol as its ground. Each resource is accessible under a clearly named URL, and the HTTP response codes are used to deliver status. We use HTTP Verbs like GET and POST to interact with the resources. To support accessibility by clients directly, our servers support cross-origin resource sharing. We use JSON for all our payloads, including error messages. All these characteristics mean that you will be able to use standard off-the-shelf software to interact with our platform. To make the integration even easier, we also offer SDKs that wrap both the complete Server API as well as the complete Client API. How you can obtain Commerce API keys? Find all the integration keys for public API and private API in the Commerce Account settings \u2192 Integration . Description of the transaction status codes 201 : Successfully created 4xx : Creation failed. Check Server response for details 5xx : Server error. Need to clarify operation state via API request Is the CVV stored in card payment processes? Corefy properly maintains PCI-DSS compliance for processing of Card Not Present transactions. That means the CVV, submitted by the client and sent to the issuer bank with the first payment attempt, should not be stored. So that it cannot be sent for recurring series transactions. Corefy includes to payload a recurring flag that goes out to the issuer bank and alerts about CVV is not coming with repeat authorizations you submit. This possibility is based on the recurring nature of the agreement or relationship with your client. May 3D Secure be enabled only for certain payments and countries? When 3D secure is enabled for all card types; by default 3D authentication will take place for card transaction in all countries. Corefy includes to payload a recurring flag to alert the issuing bank about skipping the 3D secure check. This possibility is based on your business logic and relationship with your clients. Can you save a card and charge it later? If you create card payment invoice with enabled tokenization, we save card details on our servers and store a related token on your side. You can use this token to charge the card at a later date. To resolve any other refund issues, contact our support team , and we will help you as soon as possible. Does token have an expiration date? A token is valid until expiring the linked card. How long does it take to receive a response from the payment platform? On average, the Corefy platform responds within one to two seconds. Certain responses can take a bit longer in case various third-party platforms need to be reached. Can you submit more than one refund on the same order on the same day? Yes, you can. But be aware: some local card acquirers (for example, in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Columbia) impose restrictions on multiple refunds. How do you know if the refund is successful? Refund requests are executed as a reverse payment request. It takes a few business days depending on the country and the payment provider used to credit the client's account. Once we have received the confirmation that the client has received the funds, you get a payment status refunded or partially_refunded in the Callbacks. Commerce Account Settings \u00b6 How to choose fee strategy Used value of the fee is the sum of the rate fee (in percentage with two decimal places) and the fixed fee (in base currency). Also, it always lies within the minimum and maximum setpoints (in base currency). Depending on the commerce account's payment options, Corefy platform enables to use of 4 types of fee strategy: Internal strategy and Direct calculation fee_strategy:internal , reverse_fee:false Internal strategy and Reverse calculation fee_strategy:internal , reverse_fee:true External Strategy and Direct calculation fee_strategy:external , reverse_fee:false External strategy and Reverse calculation fee_strategy:external , reverse_fee:true Any set of options can be chosen as the preferred, at your discretion. Check the different types of fee calculation at Google Spreadsheets \u2192 And thereby: Internal strategy and Direct calculation: Paid Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Input Amount + Fixed Fee; Deposit Amount = Input Amount - Fee; thus: \\[ {Deposit Amount} = {Input Amount} \\times {\\frac{100\\% - {Rate Fee}} {100\\%}} - {Fixed Fee} \\] Internal strategy and Reverse calculation: Deposit Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Paid Amount + Fixed Fee; Paid Amount = Input Amount + Fee; thus: \\[ {Paid Amount} = \\frac{({Input Amount} + {Fixed Fee}) \\times 100\\%}{100\\% + {Rate Fee}} \\] External Strategy and Direct calculation: Deposit Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Input Amount + Fixed Fee; Paid Amount = Input Amount + Fee; thus: \\[ {Paid Amount} = {Input Amount} \\times {\\frac{100\\% + {Rate Fee}} {100\\%}} + {Fixed Fee} \\] External strategy and Reverse calculation: Paid Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Deposit Amount + Fixed Fee; Deposit Amount = Input Amount - Fee; thus: \\[ {Deposit Amount} = \\frac{({Input Amount} - {Fixed Fee}) \\times 100\\%}{100\\% + {Rate Fee}} \\] where Input Amount \u2014 amount \u2014 initiated amount of the invoice; Paid Amount \u2014 payment_amount \u2014 value to be paid by the customer; Deposit Amount \u2014 deposit \u2014 amount to be charged to the account, always less than payment_amount by fee ; Fee \u2014 fee \u2014 current fee amount (don't forget that its value lies within the minimum and maximum setpoints). Transactions handling \u00b6 Does the transaction has an incorrect status? Go to the transaction Overview page and add the valid statement and related provider data manually. Unable to initiate invoice via Public API? Turn off the Forbid creation through the Public API option in the Commerce account settings (Payment options) How to understand that the transaction with a certain ID(Reference ID) successfully created in the Corefy system You should reconcile the transaction status or use response codes: 201 : Successfully created 4xx : The request is unsuccessful. Check the request and authorisation data. 5xx : Server error. Check the transaction status. If there is no transaction with this ID on the server, you can request the creation method again Additionally, Analytics service can be used to get operations by statuses, resolutions or another property. What is the difference between a transaction status and a resolution? Status describes a current state of the transaction. Resolution describes and extends a reason why the transaction has the relevant status. Do you get \"OK\" resolution and status relates to the ERROR or FAIL group? Resolution is a description of the status, but they are independent. Each status can combine with \"OK\" resolution: it means the process occurred in the planned scenario. What is the difference between Payment Invoice processed_amount and amount ? Amounts with processed -prefix are the actual amounts after the payment process is completed. processed_amount \u2014 amount that was paid by the customer (can be less than initiated payment_amount , in that case, we recalculate the fee ) processed_fee \u2014 fee that was taken from processed_amount processed_deposit \u2014 amount that was charged to the account Basic rules for the amount verification: payment_amount = deposit + fee processed_amount = processed_fee + processed_deposit processed_deposit = deposit processed_amount = payment_amount where payment_amount \u2014 value to be paid by the customer deposit \u2014 amount to be charged to the account, always less than payment_amount by the fee fee \u2014 current fee amount How to block a p2p-payment if payouts cannot be processed on it Find the payment by an external (Reference) ID Find the related p2p-payment by payment ID ( pay_... ) Set a moderation status for the p2p-payment API Security \u00b6 Is it necessary to whitelist your IP in the white access list to API? IP whitelisting is not required to access REST-based API calls. But to enhance the API security and as an additional test either, your public IP address(es) need to be whitelisted in our portal. Have you found an answer to your question? If no, ask our support team , we are always here for help! Corefy HPP \u00b6 How do you enable the device-specific Checkout page? The Corefy HPP is responsive. The page adapts to the screen size and format of your client's device. This makes sure that the payment page is optimized for use on desktop, tablet and mobile phone screens, both in the portrait and landscape modes. If you wish to create specific versions of your checkout page for specific devices, you can create and design as many variants as want. And through the REST API, you can direct your users to each of these variants. Is it possible to hide the header, footer, or any other basic elements of the HPP? You can hide any of the elements other than the main: client-available payment methods. Test the look and feel of the HPP in the Sandbox and choose the best combination of options. Which browsers does the HPP support? The following browsers are supported: Desktop: Chrome version 41 and later Firefox version 43 and later Safari version 8 and later Opera version 12 and later Edge version 14 and later Internet Explorer version 11 and later Mobile: Chrome version 41 and later Firefox version 15 and later Safari version 9 and later Samsung Browser 8.2 and later Silk Browser 72 and later For any browsers not in the list, the HPP may work, but compatibility is not guaranteed.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"getting-started/faq/#corefy-faq","text":"Welcome to the Frequently Asked Questions about interaction and working with Corefy!

The two levels of security are a password and a unique special code generated by an authentication app installed on a mobile device. Tip Popular authentication apps' examples are Google Authenticator and Authy . If 2FA is enabled, a user receives a temporary 6-digit code which can be used only for a very short period: about 20 seconds. After 20 seconds the code will expire and a new code will be generated. The requirement to enter both the password and this 6-digit code makes an account better protected. Even if the password is compromised (make sure to never reveal it to anyone!), the account cannot be accessed without direct access to the mobile device. Enable 2FA in account preferences \u2192 User profile settings . 3 \u00b6 3D Secure \u00b6 Three-Domain Secure (3DS), also known as a payer authentication, is a security protocol that helps to prevent fraud in online credit and debit card transactions.

Info When you, as a merchant, have 3D Secure enabled on your website and your customer uses the card that is enrolled in the 3D Secure program, the process looks as follows: The customer enters their credit or debit card information in the payment form. Payment system contacts a directory server and gets the message that the card is registered in the program. The customer sees the 3D Secure page when they need to authenticate themselves to the issuing bank by entering the password or a one-time PIN. The result of the 3DS authentication goes to the payment system and then it submits transaction details to the acquirer. The transaction is authorized or denied by the acquirer. The customer can see the response about whether the transaction is successful or failed.

All you have to do is log in with your credentials and you can start setting up your provider accounts and related settings. This would be the quickest way to kick start billing with Corefy. You could always decide to switch to Corefy's API for handling your payment needs.

These approaches include a URL Redirect to a third-party hosted payment page, inline iFrame, embedded content in a merchant's page such as Direct Post or JavaScript-built forms, and directly against an API.

The list of all available integrations can be found in the Connectors . To connect a Payment Provider , follow these steps: Click on New Connection section to access providers directory. Select the desired provider and click on its logo. Payment providers, that are available for connection, are marked with Ready flag in the top right corner.

Immediately afterwards, Corefy will automatically check all available payment methods, payment and payout routes in supported currencies for your merchant account in the payment provider or acquirer. Now all is done! Creating routing schemes \u00b6 After connecting to a payment provider, you need to set up Payment and Payout Gateways .

You can choose which of them you want to use in that scheme, set up routes and choose a strategy and conditions. Click on the right line to go to the level below ([Routing Scheme] \u2192 [Service] \u2192 [Rule] or [Route]). Into the Details: Fee Optimizing The used value of the fee is the sum of the rate fee (in percentage with two decimal places) and the fixed fee (in base currency). Also, it always lies within the minimum and maximum setpoints (in base currency). Depending on the commerce account's payment options, Corefy platform enables to use of 4 types of fee strategy: Internal strategy and Direct calculation: Paid Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Input Amount + Fixed Fee; Deposit Amount = Input Amount - Fee; thus: Internal strategy and Reverse calculation: Deposit Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Paid Amount + Fixed Fee; Paid Amount = Input Amount + Fee; thus: External Strategy and Direct calculation: Deposit Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Input Amount + Fixed Fee; Paid Amount = Input Amount + Fee; thus: External strategy and Reverse calculation: Paid Amount = Input Amount; Fee = Rate Fee \u00d7 Deposit Amount + Fixed Fee; Deposit Amount = Input Amount - Fee; thus: where Input Amount \u2014 amount \u2014 initiated amount of the invoice; Paid Amount \u2014 payment_amount \u2014 value to be paid by the customer; Deposit Amount \u2014 deposit \u2014 amount to be charged to the account, always less than payment_amount by fee ; Fee \u2014 fee \u2014 current fee amount (don't forget that its value lies within the minimum and maximum setpoints).

Corefy has a Test Mode you should use for testing. It operates separately from live mode, so you can make changes without affecting your live data. You should use the same accounts in test and live modes when testing your integration. It makes testing more consistent across the two modes, and you don't have to maintain as many accounts. Whether a transaction was created in the test or live mode is dictated by which API keys. Keep in mind that in Test Mode only test routes will be available. Connecting a commerce account \u00b6 After setting up at least one payment scheme and at least one payout scheme, you can create a Commerce scheme to link them for commerce accounts. You also can create an exchange rate scheme beforehand or use the default system scheme instead. You can always change the Commerce scheme for a Commerce account if you wish. A Commerce Account is used by the organisation to account all websites, projects, stores, storefronts, business accounts, points of sale, etc. You can set individual rules for each Commerce Account, processing transactions and payment services available in it.

To set up Callbacks for an object, set a callback_url on that object. Whenever something important happens to the object that we think you should be notified of (typically a state change), we will make an HTTP POST request to your callback_url with the object_id in the body of the request. Note Callbacks are asynchronous and are not recommended for time-critical applications. It is very much possible and even likely that callbacks reach your application out-of-order and that they get duplicated. For time-critical applications, we recommend using the API to poll our system for updates. Configure Callbacks \u00b6 To configure your callbacks, go to Commerce Settings > Integration > Callbacks and add a callback URL. Callback Requests \u00b6 The HTTP request that we make to your callback_url will have the following characteristics: It will be a POST request. Request Body will be in JSON-API format. It is the same as in public API. The object type and id will be in the body of the request (and not added as a url-parameter). This an example for Payout Invoice operation callback data: { \"data\" :{ \"type\" : \"payment-invoices\" , \"id\" : \"cpi_UoIW6RdSYyIRj8vR\" , \"attributes\" :{ \"status\" : \"process_pending\" , \"resolution\" : \"ok\" , \"moderation_required\" : false , \"amount\" : 4 , \"payment_amount\" : 4 , \"currency\" : \"UAH\" , \"service_currency\" : \"UAH\" , \"reference_id\" : \"e2041fe2-44da-44da-0090-4ffe9d2f25d0\" , \"test_mode\" : false , \"fee\" : 0 , \"deposit\" : 4 , \"processed\" : null , \"processed_amount\" : null , \"processed_fee\" : null , \"processed_deposit\" : null , \"metadata\" :[ ], \"flow_data\" :{ \"action\" : \"https://cardgate.example.io/hpp/2018e26d-8882-57f6-9a91-ac2acfeedbe3\" , \"method\" : \"GET\" , \"params\" :[ ] }, \"flow\" : \"hpp\" , \"created\" : 1560889898 , \"updated\" : 1560889898 , \"payload\" :[ ] }, \"relationships\" :{ \"payment-service\" :{ \"data\" :{ \"type\" : \"payment-services\" , \"id\" : \"payment_card_uah_hpp\" } }, \"payment-method\" :{ \"data\" :{ \"type\" : \"payment-methods\" , \"id\" : \"payment_card\" } } }, \"links\" :{ \"self\" : \"/api/payment-invoices/cpi_UoIW6RdSYyIRj8vR\" } } } You also have the option to exclude card object from the callback. Enabling this will remove the masked card details object from the callback. Note Although only masked card details are sent as part of the callback data, we recommend this option be enabled as the data could still be used for phishing attacks in case your site suffers a security breach. API Version \u00b6 Corefy supports multiple API versions. The event content sent to the callback is structured based on the API version selected. Hence it is crucial that the API version of the callback matches the API version of the client library used by your application server. Learn more about API versioning here . Signature \u00b6 Corefy sign data using secret keys. They can be obtained in organization or Commerce Account settings. All callbacks are signed live or test secret key according to the mode in which operation has been created. Corefy sends signature in X-Signature callback request header. The signature is created by next algorithm: $signature = base64_encode(sha1($secret . $callbackData . $secret, true)); Where the $secret is one your secrets: test or live , $callbackData is raw json data. Note To be sure you got data from Pay\u0421ore, you should compute the signature using an appropriate secret key and compare with ones from Corefy callback data. Timeouts \u00b6 There are 3 timeouts for Callbacks in Corefy: Connection Timeout: The connection timeout is the timeout for making the initial connection to the callback URL's HTTP server. Read Timeout: Once the initial connection has been made, at any time there is a possibility that there is an indefinite wait to read data from the HTTP server. The read timeout is the timeout for such a wait. Total Callback Timeout: In addition to the above timeouts, Corefy also checks the total execution of time of any callback via the callback execution timeout. The values for each timeout are as follows: Timeout For Test site For Live site Connection Timeout 10,000 ms 20,000 ms Read Timeout 10,000 ms 20,000 ms Execution Timeout 20,000 ms 60,000 ms Automatic Retries \u00b6 When you successfully process callback request, you must return 200 HTTP status code. Our application ignores any other data return by callback. If the callback returns status code other then 200, it is assumed the delivery of request failed. The failed callback request is resent with an increasing delay between each attempt: the 1 st retry 1 minute after the initial attempt, the 2 nd retry 2 minutes after the 1 st retry, the 3 rd retry 3 minutes after the 2 nd retry, the 4 th retry 4 minutes after the 3 rd retry, the 5 th retry 5 minutes after the 4 th retry, the 6 th retry 6 minutes after the 5 th retry, and so on, up to 100 attempts or up to receiving 200 HTTP status code. You can set up delays between Callbacks' requests and the number of attempts in the Commerce settings. Additionally, you can avoid receiving unnecessary messages in Callbacks by toggling the \"Only final\" statuses option. Note You could resend a callback manually if you wish to sync your data immediately. Go to Operation overview > Callbacks , select the callback and use the button on the right side to resend it. Callback Handling \u00b6 Because HTTPS/SSL verifies the identity of the server you are making API calls to, you will always know that the updated information you are receiving is correct. If we sent object information in the Callback itself, you would have to verify the authenticity of the information via signed request, etc. Duplicate Handling \u00b6 Due to callback retries, it's possible that your application receives the same callback more than once. Ensure idempotency of the callback by detecting such duplicates within your application. To control processing idempotency use by examining the id parameter in callback request data since its value is unique to an operation and thus identifies it. For some applications, this is not a serious issue. Work that can be repeated without changing the outcome is called idempotent. If your app's actions are always idempotent, you don't need to worry much about concurrency. Batching \u00b6 We will batch Callbacks for the same object that are very close together. So if a payment goes from state created to invoked to processed immediately, you will only receive one Callback and when you look up the status of the payment it will be processed . The advantage of doing this is that it prevents us from overwhelming your server(s) with HTTP requests and it prevents your app from having to build complicated logic around sequential state changes. Your app should only care about the latest state the object is in. Out-of-Order Delivery \u00b6 Callbacks can also arrive at your application out-of-order. This can be due to issues such as network delays or callback failures. However, you can determine the order of the events by examining the updated attribute of the resource sent by the callback. updated is timestamp value that updated for every change made to the resource. IPs whitelist \u00b6 We use Amazon's EC2 for our infrastructure and currently we do not have a static IP address assigned. IP addresses for our instances are automatically allocated by Amazon, as we scale up or down. Hence, we are unable to provide any specific IP address for whitelisting.","title":"Callbacks"},{"location":"integration/callbacks/#callbacks","text":"Callbacks allow you to receive notifications whenever the state on an object changes (or something important happens to that object).

If it is not secure, business relationships can be compromised and a single security breach can be a death-knell for your business. The threats can come in many forms: Infecting a website with malware in order to spread that malware to site visitors Stealing customer information like names, email addresses, credit card and other transaction information Adding the website to a botnet of infected sites Hijacking or crashing the site Security breaches may not only affect your consumers, it also affect you and your business. Breaches can come with high fines, penalties and other costs. Your business can be only successful if you build up trust and a vital relationship to your customers. Even if a security breach at a small business website maybe doesn\u2019t trigger a data breach, it can still have a huge impact on customer trust. The most reason why people don\u2019t lock up their website is lack of awareness of the risk and consequences.

Combine our solutions and the Google suggestion to enable secure, one-touch payments in your stores for all devices (smartphones and PCs), irrespective of the operating systems and web browsers. Google Pay\u2122 is an instant payment that allows quick and easy card transaction without having to input your payment data each time. You reduce customers\u2019 time to buy and make them far less likely to drop their carts. And you can be sure that their sensitive card data is securely stored by Google. Google Pay and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. Implementing Google Pay with the Corefy HPP \u00b6 How to set up \u00b6 Sign a contract with Corefy. Review and agree with Google Pay Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy . Inform your Corefy account manager about. That's all! We integrate the Google Pay button to the Hosted Payment Page for you. Thus you can create a payment invoice from the Dashboard or via the API and start processing Google Pay transactions through Corefy. How it works \u00b6 You request the customer payment data from your application/checkout page. You send the invoice request to Corefy , and we respond with the HPP redirect form. The Hosted Payment Page displays available payment methods to the customer, including Google Pay option. Google Pay authenticates the customer and returns their encrypted data. We decrypt received payment data. We create the purchase request and transfer the card data to the payment service provider (PSP) or bank acquirer service to complete the transaction and obtain a payment response. The acquirer can request an additional user verification step by passing a 3DS or OTP test; in that case, the customer gets the verification page from the issuer. We get the response value received from the issuer 3DS service and finalize the transaction. We send a Callback message to the application back-end; if the Callback URL is not set, we expect a status request from your server. You inform the customer about the result. Implementing Google Pay directly through the API \u00b6 Before you start \u00b6 Be aware Your site should run on the HTTPS scheme and support the TLS 1.2 protocol. To integrate Google Pay into your Android application, check the links below: Google Pay Android developer documentation Google Pay Android integration checklist Google Pay Android brand guidelines To integrate Google Pay into your website, review the following links: Google Pay Web developer documentation Google Pay Web integration checklist Google Pay Web brand guidelines Get verified: send mobile app (.apk) or link to your site with the payment page. How the direct integration works \u00b6 You request the customer payment data from your application/checkout page. Your application displays available payment methods to the customer, including Google Pay option. You request the encrypted payment data from your application, and Google Pay authenticates the customer. You handle the received payment data and send to your server. The application back-end transfers the encrypted data to card gateway Corefy with the invoice request to the Commerce API, and we respond with the invoice ID and the invoice status created . We decrypt the payment data, create the purchase request, and transfer the card data to the payment service provider (PSP) or bank acquirer service to complete the transaction and obtain a payment response. The acquirer can request an additional user verification step by passing a 3DS or OTP test. We send to your application back-end the ACS redirect form. You display the ACS or OTP to the customer. We get the response value received from the issuer 3DS service. We request the payment status from the acquirer and finalize the transaction. We send a Callback message to the application back-end; if the Callback URL is not set, we expect a status request from your server. You inform the customer about the result. How to integrate the Google Pay method \u00b6 The overall transaction flow is similar to the standard Google Pay process. Corefy receives the encrypted Google Pay payload from your application and is responsible for decrypting the payment token and transferring the purchase data to a chosen gateway. Make sure that you complete preparations from the previous section. Use Google Pay API to get a paymentData . As script parameters specify: Available payment methods: var allowedPaymentMethods = ['CARD'] Tokenization type: \"tokenizationType\": \"PAYMENT_GATEWAY\" Allowed card networks: \"allowedCardNetworks\": [\"MASTERCARD\", \"VISA\"] Allowed authorization methods: \"allowedAuthMethods\": \"[\"PAN_ONLY\", \"CRYPTOGRAM_3DS\"]\" Gateway parameter: paycoreio Your Google merchant ID And gateway merchant ID parameter \u2192 your unique account ID The Customer's billing address is not required for the Corefy Google Pay API requests. If your integration works properly, you will receive a Google Pay button on the payment page.

It's critical that you audit the entirety of data processing actions taking place to be able to analyze for possible security breaches. Also, this allows you to put a check and balance system in place so when things go out of control, you can figure out what went wrong, who did it, and how to fix it. Why Log User Activities? \u00b6 Obviously you trust users that is why you have given them access to do certain things on your organization. However, people make mistakes all the time. If you knew who made a mistake and what they did wrong, then you can quickly correct it and also teach the user how to avoid this mistake in the future. For example, if a moderator approved a comment that doesn\u2019t fit your comment guidelines, then you can quickly correct their mistake, notify them and it will save you time in the future.

To set up a new alert you'll need to follow these steps: First, go to Create > Alert Select the query you want to trigger an alert for (just start typing).

Select your magic number: Leave Rearm Seconds empty to get 1 alert when the status changes from Triggered to OK, enter a number to get an alert every time the query runs (by schedule) + the Rearm seconds value. Save. Define alert destinations - email is supported. Alert Status & Frequency \u00b6 The Alert Status is checked every time the query is executed - (alerts only work with scheduled queries). Alerts have 3 Status Types: TRIGGERED - the value you set the alert for is triggered (if you set your alert to trigger when the value of \"cats\" is greater than 1500 as long as it's above 1500 your alert is triggered) OK - the value you have set to trigger the alert is not reached for now (might happen after the alert was triggered or before it was ever triggered, if your \"cats\" value is now 1470 your alert will show as OK) UNKNOWN - you should see this status once you have set your alert and it wasn't yet checked. To make your alert in the know, run the query it is linked to after setting the alert. Get an Alert Upon Status Change \u00b6 If you leave the REARM value empty alerts will only be sent when the status changes (from OK to Triggered or vice versa). Get an Alert Everytime the Query Runs \u00b6 To get an alert every time the query runs, set the REARM value - the value is for seconds that pass since the system detects a change until it sends the alert, a 1-minute \"delay\" would require entering '60' in the REARM field. Alert Destinations \u00b6 PayCore.Analytics supports a vast amount of Alert Destinations. The latest list includes: Email, HipChat, Mattermost, PagerDuty, WebHook, Slack, ChatWork. Prior to sending alerts to one of the above destinations, there is a need to define and configure them.

Only users with admin rights can create new destinations, but any user can use them in their alerts once created. Multiple Column Alert \u00b6 There's an indirect way to set an Alert based on multiple columns of a query: Your query can implement the alert logic and return a boolean value for the Alert to trigger on. Something like: SELECT CASE WHEN drafts_count > 10000 AND archived_count > 5000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END FROM ( SELECT sum ( CASE WHEN is_archived THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS archived_count , sum ( CASE WHEN is_draft THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS drafts_count FROM queries ) data This query will return 1 when drafts_count > 10000 and archived_count > 5000 .

Start by clicking the Add Widget button. Search existing queries or pick a recent one from the pre-populated list: Picking Visualizations \u00b6 By default, query results are shown in a table. At the moment it's not possible to create a new visualization from the \"Add Widget\" menu, so you'll need to open the query and add the visualization there beforehand ( instructions ). Adding Text Boxes \u00b6 Add a text box to your dashboard using the Text Box tab on the Add Widget dialog. You can style the text boxes in your dashboards using Markdown . You can include static images on your dashboards within your markdown-formatted text boxes. Just use markdown image syntax: ![]( <url for image > ) Dashboard Filters \u00b6 When queries have filters you need to apply filters at the dashboard level as well. Setting your dashboard filters flag will cause the filter to be applied to all Queries. Open dashboard settings: Check the \"Use Dashboard Level Filters\" checkbox: Managing Dashboard Permissions \u00b6 By default, dashboards can only be modified by the user who created them and members of the Admin group. But PayCore.Analytics includes experimental support to share edit permissions with non-Admin users. An Admin in your organization needs to enable it first. Open your organization settings and check the \"Enable experimental multiple owners support\" Now the Dashboard options menu includes a Manage Permissions option. Clicking on it it will open a dialog where you can add other users as editors to your dashboard. Please note that currently the users you add won't receive a notification, so you will need to notify them manually. Favorites & Tagging \u00b6 PayCore.Analytics users write a lot of queries and dashboards! Favorites and Tagging are here to make finding them easy as your collection of queries and dashboards grows from a few hundred to a few thousand. Favorites \u00b6 You can favorite a dashboard or query by clicking the star to the left of its title anywhere in PayCore.Analytics. The star will turn yellow to indicate success. Your favorites are displayed at several places in PayCore.Analytics. They appear on the homepage, in the navbar dropdown menus and as filters in the query or dashboard list views. Tagging \u00b6 You can tag queries and queries by subject matter, location, user or any parameter that is meaningful to your organization. Tags are added from the query editor or the dashboard editor. Hover your mouse on the query or dashboard title and an +Add Tag button will appear. In the modal that appears you can select as many tags as you need. The modal will suggest previously-used tags as you type. Hit Save when you're finished or Esc to abort tagging. It's important to have predictable taxonomy for your tags. Consistency in this area makes using PayCore.Analytics an even nicer experience and helps bring new users onboard. So we recommend that your team have an internal discussion about the tag hierarchy that will be most benefecial to your organization. Your tags will appear on the Dashboard and Query list views on the righthand side. Click any tag to filter the list view instantly. Click a second time to remove the filter. Shift + Click to select multiple filters. Sharing and Embedding Dashboards \u00b6 PayCore.Analytics makes it easy to share your dashboards. Just click the Publish button on the upper right of the dashboard editor. Any logged-in member of your organization with adequate permissions can see your dashboard once it has been published. You can also share published dashboards with external users by clicking the share icon in the upper-right. A modal appears where you can generate a secret link to share safely outside your organization. External users can see the dashboard widgets but will not be able to navigate within the PayCore.Analytics application or view the underlying queries. You can revoke access to a dashboard for external users by toggling Allow public access . This will break any links to this dashboard that were shared previously. If you toggle the switch again a new secret link will be generated. Dashboard Permissions \u00b6 A logged-in user will only see dashboard widgets derived from data sources to which the user has access. Users who can view a dashboard widget can also view the underlying query. Should you need to share a dashboard within your organization while also restricting access to the underlying data source, there are two options: Give your restricted users access using the secret link method described above Create a custom data source for the restricted employees and configure permissions at the database level You can read more about PayCore.Analytics's permissions model here . Embedding Dashboards \u00b6 Some users embed their dashboards outside of PayCore.Analytics using iframes. PayCore.Analytics provides a Full Screen view to improve this experience. Full screen mode removes everything but the widget UI. Just click the full screen button to the right of the Refresh button. Then copy the URL from your browser into your iframe embed code. Embedding a dashboard in this way will require users to be logged-in to PayCore.Analytics. To embed PayCore.Analytics for external users you can use the secret link method described above.

To insert an item into your query, simply click the double arrow on the right side. You can filter the schema with the search box and refresh it by clicking on the refresh button (otherwise it refreshes periodically in the background). Please note that not all data source types support loading the schema. You can hide the Schema Browser using the key shortcut or by double-clicking the pane handle on the interface. This can be useful when you want to maximize screen while composing a query. Auto Complete \u00b6 The query editor also includes an Auto Complete feature that makes writing complicated queries easier. Live Auto Complete is on by default.

When Live Auto Complete is disabled, you can still activate Auto Complete by hitting Ctrl + Space . Live Auto Complete is enabled by default unless your database schema exceeds five thousand tokens (tables or columns). In such cases, you can manually trigger Auto Complete using the keyboard shortcut. Auto Complete looks for schema tokens, query syntax identifiers (like SELECT or JOIN ) and the titles of Query Snippets. Query Settings \u00b6 Published vs Unpublished Queries \u00b6 By default each query starts as an unpublished draft, which means that: Only the user who created this query can see it in the \"All Queries\" list or in search results. You can't add visualizations from an unpublished query to dashboards or use it in alerts. To publish a query, give it a name or click the Publish button. It's also possible to unpublish a published query by clicking on the Unpublish button in the query menu. Archiving a Query \u00b6 Once a query is no longer useful, you can archive it. Archiving is almost the same as deleting, except that direct links to the query will still work. To archive a query, open the little menu at the top-right area of the query editor, next to the Save button and click Archive. Duplicating (Forking) a Query \u00b6 If you need to create a copy of an existing query (created by you or someone else), you can fork it.

Thanks to filters, you can restrain the result to a specific or multiple values. Filters are enabled by following a naming convention for columns. If you want to focus on a specific value, you'll need to alias your column to <columnName>::filter . Here's an example: SELECT action AS \"action::filter\" , COUNT ( 0 ) AS \"actions count\" FROM events GROUP BY action Note that you can use __filter or __multiFilter , (double underscore instead of double quotes) if your database doesn\u2019t support :: in column names (such as BigQuery). If you're interested in multi filters (meaning you can select multiple values), you will need to alias your column to <columnName>::multi-filter . Here's an example: SELECT action AS \"action::multi-filter\" , COUNT ( 0 ) AS \"actions count\" FROM events GROUP BY action Query Parameters \u00b6 Unless specific to a one-time project, most queries can be reused by changing a WHERE clause (or filter block in NoSQL) to suit the present need. Yet it can be a hassle to Edit Source every time you make a minor change. Query Parameters let you insert values at run time without editing your base query. The syntax is straightforward: PayCore.Analytics recognizes any string between double curly braces {{ }} as a Query Parameter. SELECT count ( 0 ) FROM events WHERE action = '' In the above example `` is the Query Parameter. To change the value of the parameter, PayCore.Analytics places an input box above the results pane. The contents of this input box are passed to the database instead of the double curly braces whenever you execute the query.

Yet it can be a hassle to Edit Source every time you make a minor change. Query Parameters let you insert values at run time without editing your base query. The syntax is straightforward: PayCore.Analytics recognizes any string between double curly braces {{ }} as a Query Parameter. SELECT count ( 0 ) FROM events WHERE action = '' In the above example `` is the Query Parameter. To change the value of the parameter, PayCore.Analytics places an input box above the results pane. The contents of this input box are passed to the database instead of the double curly braces whenever you execute the query. Add A Parameter From The UI \u00b6 You can insert a parameter into your query and immediately activate its settings pane by using the Add Parameter button or associated keyboard shortcut. The parameter will be inserted wherever the text caret appears in your query. If you find that you've inserted the parameter in the wrong part of the query, you can select the entire parameter (including the curly braces!) and cut/paste it wherever necessary. You can discover the key shortcut on your operating system by hovering your cursor above the Add Parameter button. Parameter Settings \u00b6 You can open a parameter's settings pane by clicking the cog icon on the left: Title : by default the parameter title will be the same as the keyword in the query text. If you want to give it a friendlier name, you can change it here. Type : each parameter starts as a Text type. Supported types are Text, Number, Date, Date and Time, Date and Time (with Seconds), and Dropdown List. Prior to PayCore.Analytics version 7, the parameter settings pane in the Query Editor included a Global tickbox, which notified PayCore.Analytics that you intended to use this parameter across multiple widgets in a dashboard. The Global tickbox has been replaced since version 6 with the new Parameter Mapping on Dashboards functionality described below. Query Parameters only work within PayCore.Analytics and are not supported in embeds or shared dashboards. Also, a PayCore.Analytics user must have Full Access permission to the data source to use Query Parameters. Date Parameters \u00b6 With many databases, you can use a string value to represent a date/time which is equivalent to a Text parameter in PayCore.Analytics. PayCore.Analytics's Date parameters are preferable because they have a special calendar interface to make choosing a date easy. If you know in advance, however, that your date parameters will always come from a short list, you can instead use the Dropdown List or Query Based Dropdown List type. If you are using Query Parameters of type Date , you can set the parameter's default value to the current date and time when the query is run. While most databases include functions for querying with the current date/time ( GETDATE() in TSQL or CURRENT_DATE in MySQL e.g.), this feature in PayCore.Analytics lets you run the same query either up-to-the-minute or further in the past. Date Range Parameters \u00b6 For queries that must select data between two dates, PayCore.Analytics provides three levels of Date / Time Range parameters. When chosen from the parameters settings screen, PayCore.Analytics places two complete parameters into your query: one for the start date and one for the end date. You will typically need to separate them in your query (into different WHERE clauses, e.g.). However, the parameter selection interface below the query window displays a unified widget to easily chose a date range without unnecessary clicking. Date Range parameters behave exactly like Date parameters but are meant to save you time. Dropdown Lists \u00b6 If you want to restrict the scope of possible parameter values when running a query, you can use PayCore.Analytics's Dropdown List parameter type. When selected from the parameter settings panel, a text box appears where you can enter your allowed values, each one separated by a new line. Dropdown lists are Text parameters under the hood, so if you want to use dates/datetimes in your dropdown, you should enter them in the format your data source requires. Query Based Dropdown List \u00b6 Dropdown lists can also be tied to the results of an existing query. Just click Query Based Dropdown List under Type in the settings panel. Search for your target query in the Query to load dropdown values from bar. Performance will degrade if your target query returns a large number of records. If your target query returns more than one column, PayCore.Analytics uses the first one. If your target query returns name and value columns, PayCore.Analytics populates the parameter selection widget with the name column but executes the query with the associated value . For example, suppose this query: SELECT user_uuid as 'value', username as 'name' FROM users returned this data: value name 1001 John Smith 1002 Jane Doe 1003 Bobby Tables PayCore.Analytics's dropdown list widget would look like this: But when PayCore.Analytics executes the query, the value passed to the database would be 1001, 1002 or 1003. FAQ \u00b6 Can I reuse the same parameter multiple times in a single query? Sure! Just use the same identifier in the curly brackets. In this example: SELECT , count ( 0 ) FROM queries WHERE org_id = We use the `` parameter twice. Can I use multiple parameters in a single query? Of course, just use a unique name for each one. In this example: SELECT count ( 0 ) FROM queries WHERE org_id = AND created_at > '' We use two parameters: and . Parameter Mapping on Dashboards \u00b6 This is currently available on PayCore.Analytics and is part of the next Open Source release (v7.0). Query Parameters can also be powerfully controlled within dashboards. You can link together parameters on different widgets, set static parameter values, or choose values individually for each widget. You select your desired parameter mapping when adding dashboard widgets that depend on a parameter value. Each parameter in the underlying query will appear in the Parameters list. You can also access the parameter mapping interface by clicking the three dots on the top right of a dashboard widget, then clicking Edit Parameters . Title is the display name for your parameter and will appear beside the value selector on your dashboard. It defaults to the parameter keyword (see next bullet). Edit it by clicking the pencil glyph. Note that a titles are not displayed for static dashboard parameters because the value selector is hidden. If you select Static value as your Value Source then the Title field will be grayed out. Keyword is the string literal for this parameter in the underlying query. This is useful for debugging if your dashboard does not return expected results. Default Value is what PayCore.Analytics will use if no other value is specified. Value Source is where you choose your preferred mapping. Click the pencil glyph to open the mapper settings. Value Source Options \u00b6 New dashboard parameter: Dashboard parameters allow you to set a parameter value in one place on your dashboard and map it to multiple visualizations. Use this option to create a new dashboard-level parameter. Existing dashboard parameter: If you have already set up a dashboard-level parameter, use this option to map it to a specific query parameter. You will need to specify which pre-existing dashboard parameter will be mapped. Widget parameter: This option will display a value selector inside your dashboard widget. This is useful for one-off parameters that are not shared between widgets. Static value: Selecting this option will let you choose a static value for this widget, regardless of the values used on other widgets. Statically mapped parameter values do not display a value selector anywhere on the dashboard which is more compact. This lets you take advantage of the flexibility of Query Parameters without cluttering the user interface on a dashboard when certain parameters are not expected to change frequently. Query Snippets \u00b6 Copy and Paste are a big part of composing database queries. Because it's much easier to duplicate prior work than to write it from scratch. This is particularly true for common JOIN statements or complex CASE expressions. As your list of queries in PayCore.Analytics grows, however, it can be difficult to remember which queries contain the statement you need right now. Enter Query Snippets. Query Snippets are segments of queries that your whole team can share and trigger via auto complete. You create them at Settings -> Query Snippets . Here's an example for a simple snippet: JOIN organizations org ON org . id = ${ 1 : table } . org_id Insertion Points \u00b6 ${1:table} is an insertion point with placeholder text. When PayCore.Analytics renders the snippet, the dollar sign $ and curly braces {} will be stripped away and the word table will be highlighted for the user to replace. You can use the placeholder text as a desirable default value for the user to override at runtime. You designate insertion points by wrapping an integer tab order with a single dollar sign and curly braces ${} . A text placeholder preceded by a colon : is optional but useful for users unfamiliar with your snippet. When PayCore.Analytics renders this snippet: AND ( invoices . complete IS NULL OR invoices . complete <> '${2}' ) AND ( invoices . canceled IS NULL OR invoices . canceled <> '${1}' ) AND ( invoices . modified IS NULL OR invoices . modified_date <> '${0: this_date}' ) The text insertion carat will jump to the second line between the quote marks '' . When the user presses Tab the carat will jump backwards onto the first line. When the user presses Tab again, the carat will jump to the third line and this_date will be highlighted to prompt the user for the desired value. An insertion point of zero ${0} is always the last point in the tab order. Insert A Query Snippet \u00b6 If you have Live Auto Complete enabled, you can invoke your snippet from the Query Editor by typing the trigger word you defined in the Query Snippet editor. Auto Complete will suggest it like any other keyword in your database. If you prefer to work without Live Auto Complete enabled you can still invoke Query Snippets by pressing CTRL + Space and typing the trigger word for your Query Snippet. Here are some other ideas for snippets: Frequent JOIN statements Complicated clauses like WITH or CASE .

Package payments allow to send up to 1000 payments from one currency account to different cards and accounts using any of the connected methods, if necessary - with conversion to other currencies. All you need to do is prepare the file in .csv format and load it into the Dashboard.

Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line has the same number of fields. The CSV file format is supported by almost all spreadsheets and database management systems, including LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, Numbers, KCells, Google Spreadsheets. Separator selection is defined when creating or importing a file. Corefy uses a comma , in batch payouts as the column separator and a semicolon ; as the separator for properties in objects. The top row of the table should contain the column headings: service as a payout service (payout method + currency code) service_amount as a payout amount in the chosen currency fields_data is an object with payment details (for example, an account or a credit card number) reference_id is a unique payout item ID All the following rows are the values of the associating fields. You can also add columns for objects with client data: customer and customer_metadata . If either one or both these objects are present in the row, you must specify the reference_id in the customer object field. Thus, the customer's updated data and the corresponding payout record will be added to the customer section database. Example of a batch payout table service,service_amount,fields_data,reference_id,description,customer,customer_metadata test_usd,100,account:587964,BI10,test,reference_id:example_ref1;email:test@example.com;phone:+12345678945;name:John S, swift_usd,1,swift_code:TESTUAUKXXX;account_number:GB94BARC193459;recipient_name:John;country_code:UA;address:Kyiv;purpose:test,BI20,test swift,reference_id:example_ref1,key:value;know:nothing payment_card_usd,50,card_number:5519283812030000,BI30,test cards,, The same example as a CSV file \u2192 Create the Batch in the Dashboard \u00b6 Click the +New button in the Dashboard ( Transactions \u2192 Batch Payouts ), and upload your prepared CSV file. Required fields: the commerce account the related currency account for the write-offs: if the currency of the selected payment service differs, we convert the funds on the current exchange rate the batch name The single item reference ID is created by connecting two elements: the batch ID and the payout reference_id specified in the table's corresponding CSV cell. This final reference ID must be unique. If you use the same batch file several times without changing the reference_id values in the rows, you should specify the different batch IDs. Or leave the ID field blank: if the batch ID is not defined, it will be set automatically by the date and time of creation (as yyyyy-mm-ddThh-mm-ss ). Check Items and Process \u00b6 We validate the resulting payout batch at the initial stage.

Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line has the same number of fields. The CSV file format is supported by almost all spreadsheets and database management systems, including LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, Numbers, KCells, Google Spreadsheets. Separator selection is defined when creating or importing a file. Corefy uses a comma , in batch payouts as the column separator and a semicolon ; as the separator for properties in objects. The top row of the table should contain the column headings: service as a payout service (payout method + currency code) service_amount as a payout amount in the chosen currency fields_data is an object with payment details (for example, an account or a credit card number) reference_id is a unique payout item ID All the following rows are the values of the associating fields. You can also add columns for objects with client data: customer and customer_metadata . If either one or both these objects are present in the row, you must specify the reference_id in the customer object field. Thus, the customer's updated data and the corresponding payout record will be added to the customer section database.

For online businesses, multiple currency accounts enable to support billing in multiple currencies and consolidate transaction data made in the same currency for accounting and financial management purposes. Contract Schemes \u00b6 Contract Schemes create a set of rules comprising routing and FX-rate schemes for both incoming and outgoing transactions in supported currencies. Before you'll be able to create a Commerce Account, firstly, you need to create a contract scheme. This is due to requiring that every commerce account has linked to a certain Contract Scheme. Online businesses can create multiple Contract Schemes to be assigned to numerous Commerce Accounts to support different types of offerings or multiple storefronts. The ability to assign one Contract Scheme to any number of Commerce Accounts allows FinTechs and marketplaces to apply the same conditions to a certain group of merchants (i.g. toy retailers or ticketing) such as available payment methods, commissions, reserves, etc. Payment and Payout Invoice \u00b6 Three types of transactions occur in Corefy : invoice, request and payment or payout. A Payment or Payout is a low-level operation that initiates a financial transaction in the defined payment provider system using the specified payment method, it simply provides a connection with an external provider and the mapping of statuses. A Payment or Payout Request is an operation with rich functionality that initiates one or multiple payments or payouts depending on the conditions set in the routing and exchange rate schemes. A Payment Invoice or Payout Invoice is a high-level operation that initiates not only payment or payout request, correspondingly, but also Ledger account transactions. An invoice includes information about a currency, commission and exchange rate. This new functionality allows online businesses to apply payment fee for all incoming and outgoing transactions separately for every Commerce Account. For example, Uber and Fiverr take a 20% fee rate, while Freelancer charges 10% per transaction. Transaction fees are usually the main revenue stream of payment processors. Payments hierarchy \u00b6 Three types of incoming transactions occur in Corefy: Payment Invoice \u2192 Payment Request \u2192 Payment Payment is a low-level operation that initiates a financial transaction via the defined payment provider using the specified method. It simply provides communication with an external provider and the mapping of statuses. Payment Request is an operation with rich functionality that initiates one or multiple transactions depending on the conditions set in the routing and exchange rate schemes. Payment Invoice is a high-level operation that initiates following Payment Request and Ledger account transactions. Payouts hierarchy \u00b6 Three types of outgoing transactions occur in Corefy: Payout Invoice \u2192 Payout Request \u2192 Payout Payout is a low-level operation that initiates a financial transaction via the defined payment provider using the specified payout method. It simply provides a connection with an external provider and the mapping of statuses. Payout refers to the financial return, or monetary disbursement of investment, or annuity. Payout Request is an operation with rich functionality that initiates one or multiple payouts depending on the conditions set in the routing and exchange rate schemes.

In most cases, exchange rates are free-floating and rise or fall based on supply and demand in the market. But others are strictly regulated by the decisions of governments or central banks. Types of Exchange Rates \u00b6 A fixed or pegged exchange rate is linked to another currency or asset (often gold) to derive its value. Such an exchange rate mechanism ensures the exchange rates' stability by associating it to a stable currency itself. On the Paycore.io platform, it also means that the exchange rate for a currency pair is the same for both buying and selling. Flexible commercial or business exchange rates are the interbank rates that fluctuate prices at which banks trade currencies. The bid price refers to the highest price buyers pay for a currency in the pair currency. The ask price refers to the lowest price sellers accept for a currency in the pair currency. The difference between these two prices is known as the spread. A smaller spread means greater liquidity of the given currency.

Rate Schemes \u00b6 We use Rate Schemes to define rules and conditions for currency exchange in transaction processing. ' System ' is a default rate scheme.

The 'Allow fallback to System scheme ' option helps avoid exchange errors when a rule about some currency pair is missing in the current rate scheme.

The payment page itself is hosted by Corefy and takes care of building forms, validating the input and securing your customers\u2019 payment details. You can easily adapt the look and feel of that page in the Dashboard > Commerce Account > Settings . Give the page your desired look and feel \u00b6 The look and feel opens up the Account settings, in which you can easily alter the look and the feel of the payment page yourself. The language packs make it possible to upload your own localization. The subdomain settings allow you to choose a part of the subdomain yourself. Test URL allows you to set a test url so you are able to test a variant easily on any device with a browser. If you have multiple merchants linked to your account, remember to chose the right merchant first before visiting any of the pages below the merchant settings. Edit the payment page \u00b6 The MyCheckout editor is the tool to customize all your payment pages. This tool comes with a guided tour which will explain the available options to design your payment pages the way you like it. The first time you open this tool you will get notified by a popup in the bottom left corner of the screen. Clicking the question mark in the bottom left corner is also the place where you can always restart the tour. The editor allows you to change elements such as: the logo, background colors, background images, buttons, fonts, input fields, and much more. Payment methods \u00b6 Our Corefy's Hosted Payment Page supports all payment methods in the world, so credit cards, wallets, bank transfer etc. Some of these methods are hosted on the page itself and some require a redirect to the third party (e.g. Corefy). Methods that are hosted on the page itself will follow the styling you configure in the Dashboard. Redirect methods will not, as their visual appearance is not handled by the Corefy platform. Logo \u00b6 When provided your logo will appear on the Hosted Payment Page, its position will depend on the Customer\u2019s browser capacities as HPP as different responsive designs. Image has to be served over HTTPS to avoid all kind of security warning on the Customer\u2019s browser. Url of the logo, must be served over HTTPS. Property Value Key logo_url Type String Default none Example { \"options\" : { \"logo_url\" : \"https://example.com/logo.jpg\" } } Background Images \u00b6 Use this parameter to send a list of images to use as backgrounds on the payment page. HPP will use the image that fits the better to the Consumer\u2019s browser capacities using the width parameter given. Images have to be served over HTTPS to avoid all kind of security warning on the Consumer\u2019s browser. Complete purchase button labeling \u00b6 Depending on the kind of goods you are selling, use this parameter to change the label of the button on which the Customer will click to finalize the purchase. Label is localized in the locale of the Session. Value Button label in English BOOK Book Now BUY Buy CONTINUE Buy DOWNLOAD Download Now ORDER Buy RENT Rent Now SUBSCRIBE Subscribe Now Localization \u00b6 The Corefy's HPP provides out-of-the-box support for the following translations: Language Locale English en_EN Russian ru_RU Ukrainian uk_UA The translation that a shopper will see in your Hosted Payment Page is set with the locale specified in the HPP Request. For shoppers in an unsupported locale , the default language (English - EN) will be used. If you have many of these shoppers in a specific locale, you may wish to create a localization . Language packs \u00b6 The texts that are shown on the HPP are translated in 35 languages and a lot more locales, so you can offer the page in the language your customers speak. If you want to change the default text as it is provided by us, you have the following options: Change the texts for all variants: use the language pack option in the configuration center Change the text for only one variant: use the MyCheckout editor of the payment page (in the \u2018Look and Feel\u2019 section of the configuration center) White-label domain \u00b6 The main domain for the MyCheckout hosted payment pages is: com.paycore.io/hpp By default we offer a few subdomains that work for all our clients and that cannot be changed, indicated as \"shared\" subdomains. Using one of these shared subdomains works because the page shown to your consumer is based on your API key that is used when creating the URL for the hosted payment page and not on the subdomain of that URL that it does contain. In case you want a subdomain which contains a reference to your company name or own site, so that consumers will feel more confident in paying on that site, you can request up to 5 subdomains, excluding the shared subdomains. Styling \u00b6 Displaying payment and order details \u00b6 Your payment request can include your own itemised payment details, such as an order description and amount breakdown. The customer can view these payment details by selecting the information icon displayed next to the amount and currency. Preselecting or displaying payment methods \u00b6 Preselecting or displaying payment methods Which payment methods are displayed depends on the configuration setting for your merchant account; there are two options: Fixed or Flexible (also known as Fixed Split Gateway or Flexible Split Gateway). This feature is set up for your account by Corefy. For details, please contact Corefy Merchant Services. The Fixed option is used to specify the payment methods to display to customers in the HPP payment form (if these payment methods are available in the customer\u2019s country). For example, you can display only Paysafecard, Klarna, and Rapid Transfer on the payment form instead of the generic Corefy options for the customer\u2019s country. These methods will appear in the Payment method tabs where their logos will be displayed. For a list of currently supported alternative payment methods and their codes, see Payment method codes on page 10-9. Straight Through Redirect \u00b6 Straight Through Redirect is used with a single payment method code to automatically redirect customers to the Payment Method provider\u2019s website without showing the HPP payment form. Once redirected, the customer provides their name and any other details required and then confirms the payment. Straight Through Redirect reduces the number of steps to complete the payment. This option is only available if the following conditions apply: \u2022 Your merchant account is set to use Fixed payment methods \u2022 You pass a single payment method code in the payment_methods parameter \u2022 You provide a customer email address using the pay_from_email parameter. If no email address is provided, the HPP payment form will display to allow the customer to enter their email address. The customer will then need to click Proceed to to continue. For example: Proceed to ALIPAY. The following table lists the payment methods which support Straight Through Redirect: Displaying your company logo or brand \u00b6 You can display your company logo on HPP. To do this your payment request should include the logo parameter, with a secure HTTPS link to the logo on your website. See the example below. < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"logo\" value = \"https://www.google.com/acme.png\" > Embedding the HPP page \u00b6 You can embed the HPP page in your website using an iframe. You can define in which frameset the return_url and cancel_url pages should be opened upon a successful payment or cancellation by the customer. Note If you are embedding HPP in your website, you can request a version of HPP which has the header removed and the footer reduced in size, enabling a more seamless and integrated appearance on your website. For details, see Removing or reducing the header and reducing the footer on page 4-13. Below is an example of the HPP page displayed in an iframe. To prevent scroll bars appearing, the minimum sizes of the iframe for card payment is: \u2022 400px horizontally by 530px vertically - reduced header and footer option \u2022 400px horizontally by 550px vertically - reduced header option The iframe option is implemented by submitting two additional parameters in your HTML form: return_url_target Specifies a target in which the return_url value will be called upon successful payment from customer. 1 = '_top' 2 = '_parent' 3 = '_self' 4= '_blank' These values have the following results: 1 '_top' Opens the target URL in the full body of the window - the URL contents fills the entire browser window. 2 '_parent' Opens the target URL in the parent frame. 3 '_self' Opens the target URL in the same frame as the payment form. 4 '_blank' Opens the target URL in a new browser window Note The iframe option works well with card and SEPA payments. However, it may not be suitable if you are offering any alternative payments methods through Corefy, which typically redirect to third party websites of varying sizes. ## Removing or reducing the header and reducing the footer You can request a version of the HPP page without the Corefy header and amount fields. The security logo is also removed from the footer, to reduce its size. You can enable this option at any time by contacting Corefy Merchant Services. However, we recommend that you request this feature when integrating to ensure a good UI experience. See the example below. You can also reduce the size of the header by removing the payment details and merchant logo but leaving the language selector and footer unchanged as shown below: INTEGRATION OPTIONS \u00b6 Secure return_url parameter \u00b6 A secure return_url parameter allows you to be certain that the customer has arrived at your return_url page by completing the payment process, rather than by looking up the return_url value in the page source code and entering it into their browser. However, this function only guarantees that the customer has completed the payment process, not that the payment had been processed. If this feature is not activated, please contact Corefy Merchant Services. Example 1 Merchant submits return_url without additional parameters. For example: example.com/return_url.cgi In this case Corefy will redirect the customer to: example.com/return_url.cgi?transaction_id=A205220&msid=730743ed4ef7ec631155f5e15d2f4fa0 Example 2 Merchant submits the return_url with additional parameters. For example: example.com/return_url.cgi?par1=val1&par2=val2 In this case Corefy will redirect the customer to: example.com/return_url.cgi?par1=val1&par2=val2&transaction_id=A205220&msid=730743ed4ef7ec631155f5e15d2f4fa0 Securing the return_url \u00b6 If you want to be sure that the return_url for successful payments has not been intercepted or guessed by an attacker, you can add a SALT value to the URL. For example: You could concatenate the MD5 hash of the transaction ID and a SALT of your choice and add it to the URL: 12345salt shop.representative.com/order/12345/uniqueID/00495f4a86847661888f0b2b9661693c/ success/ When the customer\u2019s browser is redirected to this URL you can just compare the locally calculated MD5 value with the one in the URL. For extra safety you can send a unique SALT value with every payment transaction. Code integration examples \u00b6 Below are two examples of HTML forms that can be submitted to Corefy. The first one is a basic example. The second example uses several additional features currently available with HPP. You can use these forms, ensuring that the values are replaced with your own values. Payment method codes \u00b6 The table below describes the codes required for each payment method if passing specific payment methods in your payment request. Display logos of specific payment methods \u00b6 An alternative option is to present only the logos of the specific payment methods you want to offer your customers through Corefy. For example: You can then define, in your HTML code, which payment method to display on the Corefy Quick Checkout page when the customer selects this logo. There are two ways in which this feature can be implemented: \u2022 Fixed - only the selected payment method (or methods) is (are) displayed to the customer on Quick Checkout. The first method supplied is preselected (set as the default option). \u2022 Flexible - the selected payment method is displayed as the default option (preselected). Corefy automatically detects the customer\u2019s country (using Geolocation or the country parameter passed by the merchant) and displays a localized version of the Quick Checkout page. Only the payment methods available in the customer\u2019s country are displayed. The order of the payment methods tabs is based on the popularity and conversion rate for each method in the customer\u2019s country. Co-branded payment method logos for display on your website are available at: www.skrill.com/en/merchants/brand-centre Note: The Payment methods you want to support are specified by including the relevant payment method codes in the payment request submitted to Corefy. Alternatively, it is also possible to request that only specific payment methods be enabled.

When using this Direct Return function the URL will be masked to the buyer, appearing to still be on the Corefy.com domain. This method can be used with redirects as long as each page outputs content more than 255 characters to the browser. If Direct Return encounters a page that redirects without outputting content the process will fail and the buyer will be sent to our standard Order Processed page. This occurs usually with a header redirect, specifically content less then 255 characters. This is a common issue as many developers will set their approved URL to a script that processes the return sales parameters then silently forwards the buyer to another page. This is usually a thank you or download page for intangible products. The best solution is to handle all post-order processing on the page set as your approved URL, including the thank you message. If no redirects are used, meaning the URL is masked by our servers, then relative links will not point to the correct location. This can be corrected with the use of absolute paths on the approved URL page or by simply using a base tag in the head of the document to provide a reference for the relative paths. Header Redirect \u00b6 With the Return Method set to Header Redirect the buyer will be immediately returned to your approved URL. Using this method, the sale parameters will be returned along with the buyer using the GET method.","title":"HPP: Features"},{"location":"products/hpp/features/#hpp-features","text":"This guide assumes you have completed a HPP integration .

No coding knowledge is required. But your requirements should satisfy the below conditions: You do not have an user authentication or management system at your end and you rely on Corefy for providing it. Only after completing checkout, end users are allowed to access your product or service. You can integrate with any of our payment page experience offerings. Choose from one of our simple hosted solutions \u2014 Payment Widget or Payment Link which are based on HPP API . Integration methods \u00b6 Read about our integration methods below, then choose the one that best suits your needs. Payment Widget \u00b6 Payment widget is our simplest integration method and requires little technical know-how. It's a payment lightbox that you can easily add to your website without redirecting client to the separate payment page. Widget is integrated directly to the website page \u2014 client selects a payment method, fills out payment details and confirms payment in the widget. < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/merchant-widget-js@0.1.7/dist/merchantWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . widget . init ({ selector : \"HTML_ID_SELECTOR_TO_INSERT_WIDGET_INTO\" , public_key : \"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , }); </ script > Jump to this page for the Payment Link based integration steps. Payment Link \u00b6 Payment Link is a quick and easy solution for accepting payments. Just create, and optionally customize, a Payment Link, then copy and paste the HTML code snippet to your website. The simplest case would involve an HTML form with specific information that would be sent via a GET request. There\u2019s no need to require any the data from your customers, so all the fields will be hidden in most cases. Here\u2019s how it can look like: Simple redirect example < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"GET\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your-public-key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"reference_id\" value = \"<unique-reference-id>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay with Corefy\" /> </ form > Widget vs Link \u00b6 Feature Payment Widget Payment Link Technology JavaScript GET Request Request Validation \u2714 Error & Event Handing \u2714 Invoicing via Email or SMS \u2714 Invoicing via QR-code \u2714 Embed options \u00b6 Standard HPP : Redirect to a customizable hosted payment page. Embedded HPP : Display an overlay payment form on your site. Full-page redirect \u00b6 The Hosted Payment Page are displayed full-page in a browser. When your customers are redirected to the Hosted Payment Page, the web address for the Hosted Payment Page is displayed. Full-page redirect supports over 60 payment methods. Payment Widget Set flow field to \"redirect\" for Payment Widget integration method: window . payment_widget . init ({ selector : \"HTML_ID_SELECTOR_TO_INSERT_WIDGET_INTO\" , flow : \"redirect\" , public_key : \"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\" , amount : \"AMOUNT_OF_INVOICE\" , currency : \"USD\" , }); Embedded (iframe) \u00b6 The Hosted Payment Page are displayed in an iframe or lightbox within your website. When you redirect your customers to our payment page, the web address for your website remains unchanged, providing a more seamless shopping experience. An iframe or lightbox integration requires a more advanced integration. We apply responsive web design to payment content displayed in an iframe or lightbox. When the width of the parent page is resized, the content in the iframe or lightbox is automatically adjusted. Depending on the content being displayed, the height of the iframe or lightbox may increase. For an iframe, the content in the parent page that is below the iframe is pushed down as the payment page content expands vertically. Payment Widget Set flow field to \"iframe\" and create HTML tag to insert HPP into. Define \"selector\" key in widget configuration options; Example: window . payment_widget . init ({ selector : \"HTML_ID_SELECTOR_TO_INSERT_WIDGET_INTO\" , flow : \"redirect\" , public_key : \"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\" , amount : \"AMOUNT_OF_INVOICE\" , currency : \"USD\" , }); Self-hosted Payment Page \u00b6 Integrating using API provides you with better control.

Please make sure to understand why you should use the Hosted Payment Page and the Overview of the system before reading this documentation. The Hosted Payment Page works with a Commerce from the Corefy ecosystem. This page lists a high-level overview of all ways to integrate Corefy HPP into a website, application, web store or Smart TV service. Ecosystem overview \u00b6 Commerce\u2019s Hosted Payment Page ( HPP ) requires that you integrate different server-side REST APIs from the Corefy environment and thus requires no client-side integration. The different APIs correspond to different Corefy products and have some defined objects that interact with each other. Interaction overview \u00b6 Actors \u00b6 Payment Widget \u00b6 Commerce Public API is responsible for providing payment services, payment methods available to a Commerce Account, creating Payment Invoice and obtaining general information about its status. HPP \u00b6 The payment page is a ready-made frontend application that uses the Commerce Public API to visualize available payment services and create a Payment Invoice. After successful creation of Payment Invoice, depending on the payment flow, the client is redirected to payment to the final payment gateway. Also, HPP accepts the client after payment and displays the status of the payment to him, and then redirects him back to the merchant's website. Commerce Public API \u00b6 Commerce Public API is responsible for providing payment services, payment methods available to a Commerce Account, creating Payment Invoice and obtaining general information about its status. Commerce Private API \u00b6 Commerce Private API provides full functionality for managing Payment Invoice, obtaining full information about it, producing a refund and cancel. Callback Service \u00b6 Callback Service is responsible for delivering instant notification to Merchant Backend when changing the status of Payment Invoice. This notification can be processed on the Merchant Backend side to launch further business logic for processing a paid order. Merchant Frontend \u00b6 On the merchant side, Payment Invoice is initiated on the order payment step. This is done both through Payment Widget, and through a simple redirection to HPP with the necessary payment parameters for paying for the order. Merchant Backend \u00b6 On the merchant backend, the order is managed, payment is initiated and Payment Invoice status changes are processed. How does it work \u00b6 Technically, HPP is a companion service to Corefy Commerce that uses Corefy Payment Gateway , which can both be referred as a Payment Provider . You will have to integrate one of these APIs to create a Payment Invoice , and then use HPP to deliver the Payment experience to merchant customers.

You only have to redirect your customers to the payment form we give you. There\u2019s also no need for you to pass any PCI scans or have an SSL certificate (though having one is always recommended), since the actual payment is submitted via our secure payment page. Try it out \u00b6 Why not give HPP a test run? Click the Pay Now button below and the form will spring to life. Customer Journey \u00b6 Corefy Commerce HPP is a secure hosted payment page, where you can redirect customers from your website to make a payment through Corefy. Commerce HPP provides customers with access to a range of payment methods, based on their location and your account and integration settings. Integration to Commerce HPP is simple and requires collecting customer payment information on your website in a standard HTML form and submitting this to Corefy. Commerce HPP then collects the customer payment details needed to complete the payment, and sends these details to the relevant bank or payment provider for authorisation. After the payment is complete, the customer is returned to your website and you receive a real-time notification of the payment, which includes details of the transaction. A simplified illustration of the Corefy HPP payment flow is shown in the figure below. Full customer journey details A customer on your website decides to checkout. Your website redirects the customer to the Hosted Payment Page on the Corefy platform by submitting HTML form or calling the Private API with Payment Invoice data the amount, a payment description, a callback URL, and a Return URL we should redirect the customer to after the payment is made. The customer reaches the Hosted Payment Page, chooses a payment method and makes the payment. This process is entirely taken care of by Corefy. You don\u2019t need to do anything here. At this point Corefy returns the visitor to your website using the return_url specified when the payment was created. Your website already knows the payment was successful and thanks the customer. When the payment is made Corefy will call your callback URL informing your website about the payment\u2019s invoice status change . You should define a callback when creating the initial payment. In response to your callback being called your application just needs to issue a 200 OK status. From that response Corefy can tell that your processing of the new status was successful \u2013 for any other response we keep trying. This fetched status serves to mark the payment paid, trigger fulfilment and send out an email confirmation to the customer. Requirements \u00b6 Commerce HPP is the easiest and the quickest way to integrate checkout into your website. No coding knowledge is required. But your requirements should satisfy the below conditions: You do not have an user authentication or management system at your end and you rely on Corefy for providing it. Only after completing checkout, end users are allowed to access your product or service. You can integrate with any of our payment page experience offerings. Choose from one of our simple hosted solutions \u2014 Payment Widget or Payment Link which are based on Commerce HPP API . Integration methods \u00b6 Read about our integration methods below, then choose the one that best suits your needs. Payment Widget \u00b6 Payment widget is our simplest integration method and requires little technical know-how. It's a payment lightbox that you can easily add to your website without redirecting client to the separate payment page. Widget is integrated directly to the website page \u2014 client selects a payment method, fills out payment details and confirms payment in the widget. Payment Widget Example < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" }; </ script > < div id = \"payment_widget\" style = \"width: 375px; height: 600px;\" ></ div > Payment Link \u00b6 Payment Link is a quick and easy solution for accepting payments. Just create, and optionally customize, a Payment Link, then copy and paste the HTML code snippet to your website. The simplest case would involve an HTML form with specific information that would be sent via a GET request. There\u2019s no need to require any the data from your customers, so all the fields will be hidden in most cases. Here\u2019s how it can look like: HTML Form < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"get\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your_public_key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay\" /> </ form > URL (Link) < a href = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/?public_key=your_public_key&currency=USD&description=Some%20goods&amount=100\" target = \"self\" /> QR Code (Image) < img alt = \"Payment Link\" src = \"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=250x250&cht=qr&chl=https%3A%2F%2Fcom.paycore.io%2Fhpp%2F%3Fpublic_key%3Dyour_public_key%26currency%3DUSD%26description%3DSome%2520goods%26amount%3D100\" > Payment Link as a QR-Code Payment Link could be generated even like a QR code: Widget vs Link \u00b6 Feature Payment Widget Payment Link Technology JavaScript HTTP GET Request Request Validation \u2714 Error & Event Handing \u2714 Invoicing via Email or SMS \u2714 Invoicing via QR-code \u2714 Alternative methods \u00b6 Our additional integration methods: To study all the APIs, such as cancelling subscriptions, issuing refunds, getting the list of supported methods, go to full API References . For server-side API libraries, check out the Server SDKs section . For shopping cart systems or e-commerce solutions, such as Magento or Woocommerce, check out the CMS Modules & Shopping Cards . Read about our all integration methods for accepting payments below, then choose the one that best suits your needs . Basic integration \u00b6 Before you start \u00b6 Make sure you have your public_key . You can find it in the Dashboard , under Commerce Account Settings > Integration . If you don't have an account with us yet, sign up for your free test account at Corefy . General requirements HPP works only with: active commerce account which allows public creation for payment invoices and has at least one active currency Please contact your account Administrator if you need to set up those options for it. Step 1: Pick a integration method \u00b6 First, you need to choose a integration method . We offer two ways to integrate HPP into your website, so you can pick the one that best fits your requirements. Step 2: Add the code snippet to your site \u00b6 Next, copy the code snippet for your chosen method and add it to your checkout page. You'll need to replace the example public_key with your own, and edit the required key-value pairs to reflect the order details (see the full reference below for details). Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" }; </ script > < div id = \"payment_widget\" style = \"width: 375px; height: 600px;\" ></ div > Payment Link (HTML Form) < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"get\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your_public_key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay\" /> </ form > Step 3 (Optional): Add callback handler to your backend app \u00b6 When the payment process is complete Corefy sends the details of the transaction to the callback_url page you provided in your payment request. This is done with a standard HTTP POST. The Corefy server continues to post the status until a response of HTTP OK ( 200 ) is received from your server or the number of posts exceeds attempts_limit (10 by default). More information about handling callbacks you could find here . Embed options \u00b6 We provide two ways to integrate: Full-page redirect : Redirect to a customizable hosted payment page. The Hosted Payment Page are displayed full-page in a browser. When your customers are redirected to the Hosted Payment Page, the web address for the Hosted Payment Page is displayed. Full-page redirect supports over 60 payment methods. Full-page redirect examples Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" , target : \"redirect\" }; </ script > Payment Link (HTML Form) < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"get\" target = \"_self\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your_public_key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay\" /> </ form > Embedded (iframe or lightbox) : Display an overlay payment form on your site. The Hosted Payment Page are displayed in an iframe or lightbox within your website. When you redirect your customers to our payment page, the web address for your website remains unchanged, providing a more seamless shopping experience. An iframe or lightbox integration requires a more advanced integration. More about embedding options you could find in our Full Reference Guide .

Use the navigation on the right to find your way around the page. Redirecting customers to HPP \u00b6 You can use a Payment Link (standard HTML form) or Payment Widget (JS) to collect and pass payment and customer details to HPP. More about integration methods you could find here . When the customer selects the payment option, your website should post the HTML form containing their transaction details to: https://com.paycore.io/hpp/ . The HTML form should contain the mandatory hidden input fields listed in Configuration . You could use a secure method of obtaining a precreated Payment Invoice ID before redirecting customers to HPP, as described in Secure redirection method . Tips for improving the customer experience Any parameters that you pass through in your HTML form, such customer details as first name, last name, and email, will be automatically populated (or populated and hidden) as appropriate, on the HPP making it easier for the customer to complete these forms. You can customize the appearance of the HPP using the options described in Customization Guide . To maximise conversion, Corefy recommends that you redirect customers to the HPP in the same browser window or embed the HPP in an iframe (see Embedding on Quickstart Guide . Secure redirection method \u00b6 This method can be used to ensure that details of the payment are communicated securely between your server and Corefy. Important! We strongly recommend that you use this method when redirecting your customers to Corefy, as it does not require sending any payment parameters to their browser. This prevents customers from being able to view or modify any hidden parameters in your source code. The redirection process is as follows: Your web server makes a standard POST request with the payment parameters, using the Commerce Private API . The Corefy server prepares a Payment Invoice for the payment and returns a standard HTTP(S) response with it. Your web server takes the body of the response which contains a Payment Invoice ID value. Using this Payment Invoice ID value the customer can be redirected to: Payment Link https://com.paycore.io/hpp/?cpi=<PAYMENT_INVOICE_ID> Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . payment_widget . init ({ cpi : \"<PAYMENT_INVOICE_ID>\" , }); </ script > < div id = \"payment_widget\" style = \"width: 375px; height: 600px;\" ></ div > Configuration options \u00b6 This is a complete list of HPP configuration options. Your integration type decides how you set your parameters. General requirements HPP works only with: active commerce account which allows public creation for payment invoices and has at least one active currency Please contact your account Administrator if you need to set up those options for it. Language Encoding for Text Parameters All text fields use UTF-8 encoding. URL parameters All URL parameters must include the scheme at the front of the URL for example: https:// . For example instead of www.google.co.uk you would need to use https://www.google.co.uk . Basic \u00b6 All following fields are required : Key Type Description public_key * string Public key of your commerce account \u2014 find it in the Dashboard . amount * float The payment invoice amount. currency * string The payment invoice currency (three-letter ISO 4217 code).

Please contact your account Administrator if you need to process in additional currencies. Test mode When you're processing live payments, replace Public Live Key with Public Test Key. Optional \u00b6 Optional values allow the user to more flexibly configure the HPP and add more information about payment invoice. For example, specify the validity period of payment invoice.

Each reference_id must be a Unique Identifier , and you must manage the generation of your own keys to ensure that duplicates are not generated accidentally. Duplicate keys are only detected when provided by the same Commerce Account, so only submissions you provide can throw a duplicate error. UUIDs are very large (128-bit) numbers. To avoid the \"accidental\" creation of duplicate keys, we recommend using a randomly generated UUID for your reference_id . This is especially important when generating reference_id for different payment requests. Customer details \u00b6 The customer element contains more information about the customer making the payment. It includes customer[email] , which we can use to send an email to the shopper when the payment is authorised or refused (if you choose to enable this notification channel). Set in customer key a customer object with following optional properties: Key Type Description reference_id * string The customer's unique reference ID. email string The customer's email address. phone string The customer's phone number. name string The customer's name. metadata array[key:value] The customer's metadata.

Also, the user can configure payment link or code snippet to execute on the client page. Return URL \u00b6 Provide custom return_url so that your shoppers are returned to your website at the end of the payment process. If return_url are not provided, shoppers are redirected to one of Corefy's default result pages, where the payment journey ends. You could override the return URL on individual transactions in options key a options object with following optional properties: Key Type Description return_url string The customer's redirect URL at the end of the payment process. With Auto return turned on in your Commerce account, you can set the value of the return_url variable on individual transactions, which overrides the value of the return URL stored in your Commerce account settings. For example, you might want to redirect payers to a URL on your site that is specific to that person, perhaps with a session-id or other transaction-related data included in the URL. To set the return URL for individual transactions, include the return_url variable in the payment invoice configuration. Example: Payment with custom return URL Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , return_url : \"https://somedomain.com/\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" }; </ script > < div id = \"payment_widget\" style = \"width: 375px; height: 600px;\" ></ div > Payment Link (HTML Form) < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"get\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your_public_key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"return_url\" value = \"https://somedomain.com/\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay\" /> </ form > Note It's not possible to override the Callback URL cause of the security violations. You must specify it Commerce Account settings. Auto return the buyer to your website \u00b6 With Auto return for Corefy payments, buyers are not required to click a button to return to your website after they complete their payments with Corefy. Auto Return applies to all Corefy Payments Standards payment buttons, including Buy Now, Shopping Cart, Subscription, and Donate buttons. Auto Return shortens the checkout flow and immediately brings your buyers back to your website upon payment completion. To set up Auto Return , you need to turn it on in your Corefy account profile and enter the return URL that will be used to redirect your buyers back to your site. For more information on how to enable this feature in your Corefy account, see Auto return in the Commerce Account setup and administration guide. Localization \u00b6 HPP supports following languages in multiple regions around the world: English, Ukraininan, Russian. Key Type Description locale string The ISO 639-1 code of one of predefined languages. Enum: en , uk , ru (Default: The user browser language). Example: Payment with predefined language for the UI Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window .

By following this styling guide, you can make changes to just about anything. Display \u00b6 Language and HPP layout settings. Set in display key as an array object with the following properties: Key Type Description hide_header bool Flag to hide header on HPP. Default: false . hide_footer bool Flag to hide footer on HPP. Default: false . hide_progress_bar bool Flag to hide progress bar on HPP. Default: false . hide_method_filter bool Flag to hide method filter bar on HPP. Default: false . hide_lifetime_counter bool Flag to hide lifetime counter on HPP (if the expires date was passed). Default: false . Filtering \u00b6 Soon... This feature not currently implemented. For some payment requests, you may decide to filter the payment methods that are displayed on the HPP or bypass the HPP entirely. Set in display key as an array object with the following properties: Key Type Description show_methods array[method_codes] Flag to display specific payment methods. hide_methods array[method_codes] Flag to prevent specific payment methods from being displayed. Configured payment services All the payment services that are configured for your account, including the value you use to indicate the specific payment method, are available in the Dashboard interface under Commerce Account Settings > Payment Methods > Name . Styling \u00b6 HPP can be customized to fit seamlessly with your brand. All customizations are achieved using selectors, properties and values in a manner very familiar to developers. You can define advanced styling and customization of HPP by setting the styling property style in the configuration object. The available options for the styling object: Key Description pay_button_label Label on pay button translated on all supported languages. Enum: pay , subscribe , donate . show_method_logo Payment methods has icons or logos to show on their card previews. theme Our themes include several options to change the layout, colors and fonts of your payment page. Enum: light , dark . success_color Success color to show success notifies / messages. warning_color Warning color to show warning notifies / messages. danger_color Danger color to show danger notifies / messages. info_color Info color to show information notifies / messages. primary_color Accent color. primary_variant Based on primary color, or can be passed by you. If primary color will be dark - then this variable will be lighter. Used on most important UI components (stepper,buttons). primary_text_color Primary text color, that used mostly everywhere. primary_background_color Primary backgoround color. on_primary_color The most readable color on elements with primary color fill. Based on primary_background_color color, or can be passed by you. secondary_color Secondary color. secondary_variant Based on secondary color, or can be passed by you. If secondary color will be dark - then this variable will be a few tones lighter. Used on secondary UI components. secondary_text_color Secondary text color, used mostly on secondary UI components. secondary_background_color Secondary background color (payment method cards). on_secondary_color The most readable color on elements with secondary_background_color fill. Based on secondary_background_color color, or can be passed manually by you. Use the tabs below to view an example of styling, and a reference of selectors to use when styling your version of HPP. Button label payment_widget . init ({ public_key : \"YOUR_COMMERCE_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY\" , amount : \"100.00\" , currency : \"USD\" , style : { pay_button_label : \"pay\" , }, }); Metadata \u00b6 Configuration property: Key Description metadata Set of key/value pairs. Additional key:value info about your invoice. In the example above we suppose you will store the reference_id that\u2019s unique to the payment in your order table. This way your website is able to look-up the order for this payment when the callback is sended by Corefy. Your website is keeping track of the payment, effectively bringing about the connection between order and payment. This approach is easiest to grasp, which is why we use it in our example. Alternatively you could ask Corefy to remember the unique identifier of your order by instructing the Corefy API to store it in the payment\u2019s metadata . You would provide it while creating the payment. In our example order_id would be a good candidate. Corefy stores the metadata for you, when you fetch the payment during processing the callback the metadata is included in the response. This is another way to connect orders and payments. We advise to use the metadata approach. This is the most popular approach and it\u2019s easiest to implement. If you want to store additional/custom data at a resource's level, you can make use of Corefy's Metadata. For example, if you're a data service provider and want to store certain features of a particular plan, say \"Usage Limit\", \"Speed within limit\", etc., you can store it in the Metadata of the Plan. Considering the same example as above, if you want to store the additional features of a particular data plan here's what the JSON will look like: Example: Payment with additional fields (metadata) Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , reference_id : \"<your_unique_reference_id>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" , metadata : { \"usage-limit\" : \"5GB\" , \"speed-within-quota\" : \"2MBbps\" , \"post-usage-quota\" : \"512kbps\" } }; </ script > < div id = \"payment_widget\" style = \"width: 375px; height: 600px;\" ></ div > Payment Link (HTML Form) < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"get\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your_public_key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"reference_id\" value = \"<your_unique_reference_id>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"metadata[usage-limit]\" value = \"5GB\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"metadata[speed-within-quota]\" value = \"2MBbps\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"metadata[post-usage-quota]\" value = \"512kbps\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay\" /> </ form > Note Metadata is completely for your reference and will not be visible to customers. Metadata will not be a filter criteria, or a part of the exports. Embed options \u00b6 We provide two ways to integrate: Full-page redirect : Redirect to a customizable hosted payment page. Embedded (iframe or lightbox) : Display an overlay payment form on your site. Full-page redirect \u00b6 The Hosted Payment Page are displayed full-page in a browser. When your customers are redirected to the Hosted Payment Page, the web address for the Hosted Payment Page is displayed. Full-page redirect supports over 60 payment methods. Set target field to redirect for Payment Widget integration method. Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" , target : \"redirect\" }; </ script > Payment Link (HTML Form) < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"get\" target = \"_self\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your_public_key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay\" /> </ form > Embedded (iframe or lightbox) \u00b6 The Hosted Payment Page are displayed in an iframe or lightbox within your website. When you redirect your customers to our payment page, the web address for your website remains unchanged, providing a more seamless shopping experience. An iframe or lightbox integration requires a more advanced integration. We apply responsive web design to payment content displayed in an iframe or lightbox. When the width of the parent page is resized, the content in the iframe or lightbox is automatically adjusted. Depending on the content being displayed, the height of the iframe or lightbox may increase. For an iframe, the content in the parent page that is below the iframe is pushed down as the payment page content expands vertically. Set target field to iframe and create HTML tag to insert HPP into. Define selector_id key in widget configuration options. selector_id by default is payment_widget . Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" , target : \"iframe\" }; </ script > < div id = \"payment_widget\" style = \"width: 375px; height: 600px;\" ></ div > Payment Link (HTML Form) < form action = \"https://com.paycore.io/hpp/\" method = \"get\" target = \"payment_frame\" > < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"public_key\" value = \"<your_public_key>\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"currency\" value = \"USD\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"description\" value = \"Some goods\" /> < input type = \"hidden\" name = \"amount\" value = \"100\" /> < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Pay\" /> </ form > < iframe name = \"payment_frame\" src = \"\" id = \"payment_frame\" width = \"100%\" height = \"600\" ></ iframe > Security and cross-domain browser restrictions Although possible, using iFrames can introduce known usability, security and cross-domain browser issues. Keep the following in mind: Some redirect payment methods, such as iDEAL, do not allow displaying their pages in an iFrame; they will break out of it. Other redirect payment methods may require more available screen space than your iFrame allows. You should also be prepared to handle the difference in behaviour for the payment callback URL, as once the payment completes you may not be in an iFrame anymore. Another problem you may face is the browser's cookie policy. The HPP solution requires cookies. Using an iFrame means that the browser may impose restrictions regarding the conditions in which cookies are allowed to be set within the iFrame. While there are workarounds to get the browser to accept cookies in a default configuration, the shopper may have configured a more restrictive policy. The most common problem is with Apple Safari and Google Chrome browsers: by default, they require user-initiated page loading inside an iFrame. This means that first the iFrame needs to be loaded with a page hosted at the parent domain. Secondly, on this page the user needs to actively click on a button submitting the redirect to the HPP. Corefy cannot guarantee that all payment methods will work when using an iFrame, nor that the behaviour of a payment method will remain the same. Furthermore, the exact operation of a redirect payment method can differ between the test and the live environments. Payment Widget \u00b6 Library \u00b6 The fastest and easiest way to use our HPP is to use paymentWidget.js . To integrate the widget into your website, you can download it from the CDN or integrate the library into your javascript build. Repository: unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js CDN: Minified < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > Non-minified < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.js\" ></ script > Initialization \u00b6 We offer three ways to integrate payment_widget.js into your website, so you can pick the one that best fits your requirements: window.payment_widget.init() payment_widget.js can only be run synchronously with this method. window.HPPConfig Our recommended option, which allows you to run payment_widget.js synchronously or asynchronously. After you have specified all the required fields and customized your HPP, you will see a list of payment methods. init() < script src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . payment_widget . init ({ public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" , target : \"redirect\" }); </ script > HPPConfig < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" , target : \"redirect\" }; </ script > Configuration \u00b6 Key Type Description base_url string The link on which your HPP is located. Is necessary in case of placing HPP on your own domain (for example pay.yourdomain.\u0441om). selector_id string ID of DOM element you want HPP to insert into. Default: payment_widget . frame_id string ID of the frame that will be inserted Default: payment_frame . target string User can insert HPP inside iframe on page, or open HPP in new tab in browser iframe , redirect . Default : iframe . Example: Additional widget configuration init() < script src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . payment_widget . init ({ base_url : \"https://pay.yourdomain.\u0441om/hpp/\" , selector_id : \"payWidget\" , frame_id : \"payFrame\" , target : \"redirect\" , public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" }); </ script > HPPConfig < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window . HPPConfig = { base_url : \"https://pay.yourdomain.\u0441om/hpp/\" , selector_id : \"payWidget\" , frame_id : \"payFrame\" , target : \"redirect\" , public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : 100.00 , currency : \"USD\" , description : \"Some goods\" , }; </ script > Actions \u00b6 Method Description init(object) Accepts configuration and initializes widget with HPP. reinit(object) Accepts configuration and reinitializes widget. close(object) Accepts configuration and closes widget. Examples init() window . payment_widget . init ({ public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : \"100.00\" , currency : \"USD\" , }); reinit() window . payment_widget . reinit ({ public_key : \"<your_public_key>\" , amount : \"100.00\" , currency : \"USD\" , }); close() window . payment_widget . close ({ frame_id : \"<id_of_frame>\" , // By default: `payment_widget` }); Events \u00b6 The widget handles a number of events that are generated by HPP which you can handle for various purposes. The table below provides the full list of events that you can attach one or more handlers to. Event name When ready Triggered when HPP is registered on the global namespace and safe to use. rendered Triggered when HPP is rendered in iframe and ready to use by customer. return User click's on \"Return to shop\" button on success page. Removes the iframe from client page by default. Adding an event handler \u00b6 Events constants Event constants on the JavaScript API are accessible via payment_widget.events . There are three ways to add an event handler: Method 1 : The standard approach Bind by constant window . payment_widget . bindEventListener ( payment_widget . events . < EVENT_CONSTANT > , handler ) Bind by name window . payment_widget . bindEventListener ( < event_name > , handler ) Console logging example window . payment_widget . bindEventListener ( 'delete' , () => { console . log ( \"Iframe closing handle\" )}) Method 2 : Configuration options init() window . payment_widget . init ({ public_key : 'pk_test_<your_key>' , handlers : { < event_name >: handler } }); HPPConfig window . HPPConfig = { public_key : 'pk_test_<your_key>' , handlers : { < event_name >: handler } }; Method 3 : Listen iframe events You could listen to events directly from iframe if you don't use our Payment Widget (JS). window . addEventListener ( < event_name > , callback , false ); Get more about Cross-window communication documentation .

For example, you might want to redirect payers to a URL on your site that is specific to that person, perhaps with a session-id or other transaction-related data included in the URL. To set the return URL for individual transactions, include the return_url variable in the payment invoice configuration.

Additional key:value info about your invoice. In the example above we suppose you will store the reference_id that\u2019s unique to the payment in your order table. This way your website is able to look-up the order for this payment when the callback is sended by Corefy. Your website is keeping track of the payment, effectively bringing about the connection between order and payment. This approach is easiest to grasp, which is why we use it in our example. Alternatively you could ask Corefy to remember the unique identifier of your order by instructing the Corefy API to store it in the payment\u2019s metadata . You would provide it while creating the payment. In our example order_id would be a good candidate. Corefy stores the metadata for you, when you fetch the payment during processing the callback the metadata is included in the response. This is another way to connect orders and payments. We advise to use the metadata approach. This is the most popular approach and it\u2019s easiest to implement. If you want to store additional/custom data at a resource's level, you can make use of Corefy's Metadata. For example, if you're a data service provider and want to store certain features of a particular plan, say \"Usage Limit\", \"Speed within limit\", etc., you can store it in the Metadata of the Plan. Considering the same example as above, if you want to store the additional features of a particular data plan here's what the JSON will look like: Example: Payment with additional fields (metadata) Payment Widget (JS) < script async src = \"https://unpkg.com/@paycore/payment-widget-js@0.1.93/dist/paymentWidget.umd.min.js\" ></ script > < script > window .

Keep the following in mind: Some redirect payment methods, such as iDEAL, do not allow displaying their pages in an iFrame; they will break out of it. Other redirect payment methods may require more available screen space than your iFrame allows. You should also be prepared to handle the difference in behaviour for the payment callback URL, as once the payment completes you may not be in an iFrame anymore. Another problem you may face is the browser's cookie policy. The HPP solution requires cookies. Using an iFrame means that the browser may impose restrictions regarding the conditions in which cookies are allowed to be set within the iFrame. While there are workarounds to get the browser to accept cookies in a default configuration, the shopper may have configured a more restrictive policy. The most common problem is with Apple Safari and Google Chrome browsers: by default, they require user-initiated page loading inside an iFrame. This means that first the iFrame needs to be loaded with a page hosted at the parent domain. Secondly, on this page the user needs to actively click on a button submitting the redirect to the HPP. Corefy cannot guarantee that all payment methods will work when using an iFrame, nor that the behaviour of a payment method will remain the same. Furthermore, the exact operation of a redirect payment method can differ between the test and the live environments.","title":"Embedded (iframe or lightbox)"},{"location":"products/hpp/reference/#payment-widget","text":"","title":"Payment Widget"},{"location":"products/hpp/reference/#library","text":"The fastest and easiest way to use our HPP is to use paymentWidget.js .

When a customer buys something using a credit card, funds follow a transaction flow passing through several players to finish the payment. The main participants there are: Payer (cardholder) that decides to pay for the service. Merchant (business owner or service provider) to whose account the funds are transmitted. Acquirer processes payments on behalf of the merchant and routes them through the card networks (such as Visa or Mastercard) to the issuing bank. Seldom acquirers may attract third party providers to help process payments. Payment providers (PSP) can offer the organisation of payment reception, Internet acquiring, agency cooperation scheme, act as international or local companies, have different conditions for opening accounts. Issuer bank that extends cards to consumers on behalf of the card networks. To succeed in a payment process, you should accurately interact with each of the participants. In a nutshell \u00b6 What happens when a customer decides to pay for merchandise or service? In general, we can describe the interaction as follows: The customer places an order, fills in all necessary card (account) data for payment, and press a 'Pay' button. The encrypted data are sent to a payment gateway that collects payment details, initiates a transaction and sends data to an acquirer. Yet, the acquirer by itself may act as a payment gateway in several cases. After confirming transaction data and, optionally, checking the payer by OTP verification, the acquirer transfer data to a payment system. The payment system validates the transaction data and passes them to an issuer bank. The issuer also checks the authorisation request and responds to the payment processor with the transaction status or error details. Before this, the issuer bank may request 3DS verification from the payer. Through the payment gateway, the transaction status is returned to the merchant. The merchant displays a status page with the transaction status (accepted or denied). And the issuer bank also sends an appropriate message to the customer. Within a day or a couple of days, during clearing process, the issuing bank transfers funds to the merchant's account. The payment gateway plays an essential role by connecting the main participants. However, depending on the flow chosen, it can: process all the data on its side, or redirect the payer to the provider's payment page. In addition, the payment gateway can make the card verification (for the further payments) without writing off funds. Corefy payment gateway \u00b6 A payment gateway is a tool for accepting payments through connected payment providers interacting with them in a unified form. It takes care of authorising the invoice and ensuring that the data entered is enough to finalise the transaction and distributing funds into the currency account. The gateway protects customer data by encrypting all sensitive information it holds. And this process ensures that personal private details are passed securely between the customer, the payment provider, and the merchant. The payment gateway performs its tasks depending on supported integration methods, chosen payment flow, and transaction processing procedure defined by the provider interface. Payment gateways can execute the following transaction processing types: The authorisation type of transaction identifies whether the payment card is valid and a customer has enough funds. It doesn't include the actual money transfer. Instead, the issuer bank holds money and ensures a merchant the customer can pay for an order, usually for the one that takes time to ship or manufacture. Capture is the actual processing of a previously authorised payment resulting in funds sending to the merchant's account. Sale is a combination of authorisation and capture transactions. It's a regular payment for quick and possibly everyday purchases like a subscription or e-tickets. Refund is the result of a cancelled order for which a merchant has to apply a refund payment processing to return the money to a customer. Void is similar to the refund and used if the provider authorised but didn't yet capture funds. The benefits of the payment gateway using \u00b6 Security isn't your problem: the payment gateway takes over the purchase data safety and ensures that your customers can pay with confidence. The gateway protects customer data by encrypting all sensitive information it holds. And this process ensures that personal private details are passed securely between the customer, the payment provider, the banks, and the merchant. More straightforward integration: such payment gateways as Corefy integrate more than 100 payment service providers, and you can choose all that suit you. Multiple payment options are available: you can offer your users numerous ways to pay, not only debit and credit cards but vouchers, e-wallet and cryptocurrency payments. If you have plans to sell to customers abroad, it's worth granting a gateway accepting payments in foreign currencies. The payment gateways are independent of the bank working hours and run around the clock to process a customer's payment no matter the purchase time. Finally, using a single gateway, you collect all payments received in one spot and get reports and analysis under a unified structure so that the decision-making process becomes faster and cheaper. In the following pages, we're going closer to setting up the Corefy payment gateways and choosing payment methods and options in their variety . Note The gateway's correct work strongly depends on the payment provider accounts' proper settings. When you begin configuring Corefy payment gateway, you need to choose and set up several connections (we recommend to start with the Test connector ). And it is also advisable to check and configure the organisation's account firstly.","title":"Payment Flow and Gateway"},{"location":"products/payment-gateway/#basics-of-payments","text":"","title":"Basics of payments"},{"location":"products/payment-gateway/#payment-flow","text":"A payment transaction flow is the journey of payment from start to approval and credit funds.

Request"},{"location":"products/payment-gateway/methods-n-options/","text":"Basic concepts \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 Since the payment gateway directly depends on the integration with providers, before reading this section, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the Provider Hub. In it, you can find such concepts as: What is the Currency? What is a Merchant Account? What is a Payment Service Provider? Let's look at the basic concepts with which the payment gateway operates. What is a Payment Gateway? \u00b6 The main job of a payment gateway is to validate your customer\u2019s payment details securely, make sure the funds are available for the payment and get you paid. A payment gateway is a service responsible for processing and routing payments for online and offline businesses. It is the equivalent of a physical point of sale terminal in a shop or restaurant. It lets your customer submit their payment details and then securely passes this sensitive financial information from the customer to the merchant and then between the merchant and the Payment Provider. The payment gateway then tells you whether the charge has been approved by the Payment Provider Processing and submits your charges for settlement. A settlement is where the payment amount is deducted from your customer\u2019s payment account and deposited into your merchant account. To make a payment, the payment gateway always requires a particular merchant account. Therefore, all payments are always made in the context of some merchant account. If you have not connected any merchant account yet, we advise you to read about it in the Provider Hub section . Payment methods \u00b6 What is the payment method? \u00b6 Different payment gateways may support different payment methods. The most common payment methods are debit cards, charge cards , prepaid cards , direct debit , bank transfers, phone and mobile payments , checks , money orders and cash payments. More details can be found in the article on Wikipedia . Or take a look at a guide to payment methods . What methods does Corefy support? \u00b6 Supported by widespread access to high-speed internet and the insatiable appetite of customers for convenience, online commerce is progressing rapidly around the world and estimated to reach $4T (source: eMarketer) in 2020. But when it comes to payments online, businesses expanding internationally and taking advantage of the increased reach that online commerce provides them with are met with widely varying customer preferences. Not only can delivery terms be quite different (pay after delivery, for example, common in Europe and Asia, requires businesses to only expect payment once they\u2019ve shipped goods) but the payment methods used for online transactions themselves vary too. Credit and debit cards, not always the most trusted option, only account for half of the online transactions globally. Bank payments, digital wallets, and cash are in strong customer demand, and can even offer additional benefits to businesses such as lower risks and transaction costs. That's why, Corefy supports all the payment and payout methods implemented by payment providers that connected to our platform. A list of all supported methods can be found in our payment methods directory . Payment services \u00b6 What are payment services? \u00b6 This term is specifically introduced to identify methods in conjunction with currency. Often, payment providers use exactly the combination of method and currency. This allows you to accurately operate with one term for routing on the provider side, interacting with a single code, instead of two. Services include the properties and parameters required to initiate a payment. This is like a contract for the gateway protocol. The gateway can always expect the parameters listed in the service properties. Example: If you need to make a payment, then obviously, for this you need to send some details based on service fields. For payout service to PayPal account by email, they look like this: { \"code\" : \"paypal_usd_hpp\" , \"method\" : \"paypal\" , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"flow\" : \"hpp\" , \"amount_min\" : 0.01 , \"amount_max\" : 10000 , \"fields\" : [ { \"key\" : \"email\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"label\" : { \"en\" : \"Email\" , \"uk\" : \"\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0442\u0430\" }, \"hint\" : { \"en\" : \"Enter email\" , \"uk\" : \"\u0412\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0456\u0442\u044c \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0442\u0438\" }, \"regexp\" : \"/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&\u2019*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$\" , \"required\" : true , \"position\" : 1 } ] } What is the payment flows? \u00b6 Flow code determines the scenario of the payment processing. There are 4 basic payment processing flows: hpp \u2014 Hosted payment page. It is when a customer needs to be redirected to external HPP provided by Payment Service Provider . invoice \u2014 when a customer needs to pay by payment details. At the same time, the payment process outside the processing and asynchronous. This can be a manual transfer to a digital wallet, or bank Wire-transfer, or payment in a self-service kiosk by cash., etc. card \u2014 used for host-to-host card payment processing. Requires PCI DSS. test \u2014 used only for testing. The only difference between the payment and payout services is that the payment service has flow property. What payment services does Corefy support? \u00b6 First of all, the payment hub unifies the protocols and interaction with external payment providers. Therefore, it is necessary to have a single payment and payout service codes directory. The full directory is available here . Payment service currency VS merchant account currency \u00b6 The currency of the merchant account is actually the currency in which the payment provider is processing the payment and keep settlement funds. The currency of the payment service determines only the payment asset by which the user is calculated. Only the provider itself determines at what exchange rate the amount of the payment service is calculated against the merchant account currency. What is Payment Routes? \u00b6 Payment routes are all possible payment options for all connected merchant accounts. In fact, these are combinations of all connected merchant accounts of payment providers, their currencies, active payment services and methods. One payment route always indicates the merchant account of the payment provider in concrete settlement currency and payment service. You can manage payment routes in the settings of each merchant account in the Provider Hub and in the list of all payment routes in general . You can read more about routing in the Smart Routing section . What is a payment? \u00b6 Payment in Corefy is an operation that is responsible for the state of the process of transferring money from the client to the account merchant in the payment provider. It is important to understand that this payment process is not linear and depends on many factors. In Corefy , the minimum required unit for making and making payments is the active payment route. It has a strict bond: a merchant account, its currency and payment service. Payment service sets the list of minimum required parameters for making a payment. This may be the client\u2019s wallet number in the payment system, or his personal data, etc. When creating a payment, the payment route is always indicated, therefore there is no participation of the routing rules in this process. Routing deals with a higher layer of business logic - Payment Request Gateway. What is a payment request? \u00b6 Unlike payment, a payment request performs 2 very important roles - routing and cascading. It also, like the payment, requires to create basic parameters and service fields, but unlike a payment, it is created without specifying a specific payment route. Payment Request Processor uses Routing Schemes. What is the difference between a payment and a payment request? Payment is always processed through the payment gateway of a particular payment provider using a specific merchant account. The payment request is created only by the general parameters of the payment and, at the time of processing, dynamically determines the payment route and creates a payment for it. What is a routing scheme? \u00b6 A routing scheme is a set of rules defining for each unique payment service, a strategy for choosing a payment route. In essence, if we group all active payment routes by payment service, then these will be possible payment route options. The routing strategy determines the algorithm for selecting a payment route from this list.

To be able to do this you need to upgrade to API version V2 if you are on our older version. Configuring Multicurrency \u00b6 Note Some features are available only in selected plans. To know more, visit Chargebee's Plans and Pricing page. The Base currency is your default currency, and will also be used as your reporting currency. Other currencies that you transact in will be under Additional Currencies . 1. Adding and Managing Currencies \u00b6 Go to Settings > Configure Chargebee > Currencies and under Additional Currencies , click Enable Multicurrency Click Add Currency and select the currency. You must choose a way to set the exchange rate against the base currency. The rate can be either set manually or you can let Chargebee handle it. You can modify the settings by clicking on Manage under the more options menu for the currency. When the exchange rate is set manually for a currency, you can also schedule a change in the rate to happen at some time in the future: The option to remove a set schedule is also found at the same location. Note on exchange rates Transactions made in the additional currencies will be converted to the base currency using the exchange rates that you configure in them, for reporting purposes. Learn more . If you choose Auto as the Exchange Rate Type, Chargebee uses the exchange rates available with currencylayer and Open Exchange Rates . Here's how Chargebee picks exchange rates: If today is 4 th August 2016, The previous day's (3 rd August 2016) closing rates will be synced with Chargebee from the exchange rate sources. The synced rates will be used for transactions occurring from 00.30 UTC onwards. For transactions occurring before 00.30 UTC, Chargebee will use the closing rates from 2 nd August. If Chargebee fails to sync with the exchange rate sources on 4 th August 2016, the last available exchange rates will be used. For transactions dated prior to 2011, the closest available exchange rate for 2011 will be used for conversion. Gateways and Multicurrency Support Some gateways support transactions in multiple currencies and others don't. We recommend checking with your gateway to ensure that every transaction associated with the currencies you have enabled in your site can be processed: If your gateway requires you to configure more than one account to process multiple currencies (this is the case with Authorize.Net for example), you can connect them all to Chargebee. Once connected, make sure you configure rules to specify which account is associated with a payment method type and currency at Chargebee's Smart Routing page ( Settings > Configure Chargebee > Payment Gateways > Manage Rules ). If your gateway provides you with **multiple merchant account IDs**rather than multiple accounts to handle transaction in different currencies (as is the case with Braintree), please contact Chargebee Support with a list of your merchant account IDs and details of which merchant account ID you would like to associate with a currency enabled in your site. See also Configuring Payment Gateways: An Overview 2. Setting up your Product Catalog \u00b6 The additional currencies that you've set up will appear for selection when you create your Plans/Addons/Coupons. If you offer the same Plan in various currencies, you need to create the Plan for each of the currencies. This can be easily achieved using the Clone Plan option. Note For coupons, the option to set currencies will appear only when you set the Discount Type to Fixed Amount . If you want to link a Plan/Addon to a Coupon, both need to have the same currency configured. Subscriptions \u00b6 The currency of the Subscription depends on the Plan you select while creating the Subscription. Invoices generated for the Subscription will be in the same currency too. Note You will not be able to change the currency for existing subscriptions. If you want to change the currency for a Subscription, you need to cancel it and create a new one with the required currency. The currency of the Subscription created via a Hosted Page checkout will be based on the currency of the Plan selected by the Customer. Customers \u00b6 You can have credits , payments, invoices, and subscriptions of multiple currencies for your Customers. The currencies that you've set up will appear for selection when you add/deduct credits or payments. In the case of applying credits or payments on invoices, the currency of the credits/payment being applied and that of the invoice should match. Reports \u00b6 The reports will display aggregate values in the base currency, by default. The value of transactions in all the configured currencies will be converted to the base currency value using their respective exchange rates, and will form a part of the reports' numbers.

Generally, it needs to include all relevant factors such as a transaction amount and currency, merchant or payout accounts limits, geographic location, and many more. Without intelligent automation, finding the optimal route can become a concern. PayCore's routing engine determines the best possible route across providers and accounts to optimize all incoming and outgoing transactions in real-time settings. As an illustration of the wider use of routing scenarios and their combinations, let's explore features that will help you to benefit from Corefy smart routing. Main features: Real-time Routing Routing Schemes. Each transaction has instantly analyzed and routed to the most relevant payment provider, depending upon parameters selected in the routing setup. Easy Setup. User-defined routing schemes are to manage payment routing and configuration options to optimize for maximum payment success. Failover & Cascading. Non-IT staff can take full control and change any flow, add or suspend accounts, and many more through the web-based Dashboard. Routing Schemes \u00b6 You can benefit from almost endless routing possibilities by creating a payment routing scheme that permits you to specify your own criteria. There are many standard options including, but not limited to, geolocation, a payment amount, merchant\u2019s account balance, dates and times, transaction fees, availability, response times, gateway performance, and etc. Besides, you can set custom criteria such as a number of games played within a week or the route of the last successful transaction. The routing engine can execute an arbitrary sequence of steps defined in the routing schemes with adhered exchange rates scheme. Scheme Rules \u00b6 All the rules in the service are checked sequentially. The triggering of a rule is determined based on conditions for certain context attributes. If all conditions are satisfied, then the rule applies, and all subsequent conditions are ignored. All conditions must satisfy the criteria, the anacha, the following rule is taken. When the rule is triggered, the specified routing strategy is used (see below). Context Attributes \u00b6 Name Description Country Client's geolocation country. Examples: UA, RU. Region Client's geolocation region. Examples: africa, americas, asia, europe, oceania, polar. Subregion Client's geolocation sub-region. Examples: caribbean, central_america, central_asia, eastern_africa, eastern_asia, eastern_europe, etc. Email Customer's email. Day of month Day of the month of the current time. Day of week The week number of the month of the current time. Day of year The day number in the current time year. Amount The amount of the payment request. Amount in EUR The amount of the payment request is reduced to EUR. Amount in USD The amount of the payment request is reduced to USD. Currency Payment request currency. Routing Strategies \u00b6 A routing scheme is a set of rules defining for each unique payment service, a strategy for choosing a payment route. In essence, if we group all active payment routes by payment service, then these will be possible payment route options. The routing strategy determines the algorithm for selecting a payment route from this list. Optimal strategy \u00b6 The optimal strategy works on the principle of random selection of a payment route, taking into account its conversion and cost. Direct strategy \u00b6 Direct routing always works along the same route. In fact, this is a link to the payment service of a single route without alternatives. Fee strategy \u00b6 Corefy can dynamically determine the optimal route based on an inherent transaction fee value. It can help to optimize all transactions and ensure lower transaction fees by orchestrating cashflows across payment providers and acquiring banks. Likewise, adding two more attributes of payment request currency and payee geographic location allows for a transformation of all payments into local transactions, eliminating cross-border and currency conversion fees for international transactions. Traversal strategy \u00b6 Since PayCore allows you to work multiple payment gateways simultaneously or over time, it collects statistics on gateway-through transactions and dynamically calculates success rates by every payment route. The collected data enables you to follow the conversion optimization strategy by setting the attribute of the success rate in the routing scheme. It is worth mentioning that a large enough pool of transactional data is essentially needed to start following this strategy by a particular route. Weight strategy \u00b6 Allocation rules are used to automatically allocate your incoming transactions to the correct merchant accounts. When a payment request comes into PayCore Gateway, it will be checked against the rules, and automatically allocated to a single account which meets the allocation weightings (by percentage) across multiple accounts or account balance criteria. Of course, you can always override or edit the allocation weightings and combine with other attributes such as geographic location, transaction amount, etc. Cascading Failover \u00b6 Failed transactions are potentially the same or more important than the fees merchants pay. If any transaction fails, the routing engine will automatically reinitiate it until full execution or suspend for further investigation after a set number of attempts.","title":"Managing Routing"},{"location":"products/payment-gateway/payment-routing-schemes/#managing-routing","text":"","title":"Managing Routing"},{"location":"products/payment-gateway/payment-routing-schemes/#overview","text":"Smart routing is more complex than simply finding the most cost-efficient route.

Refunds may be partial (only a portion of the amount is refunded) or full (the entire amount is refunded). There may be several reasons for refunding a subscription such as incorrect charge, cancellation, or unsatisfactory service. In Chargebee, you can either issue a refund or record offline refunds. For both operations, Credit Notes will be generated for the refunds made. Issuing a Refund \u00b6 You can issue a refund for paid or partially paid invoices through the web interface or using the API . To issue refund through the web interface, open the invoice that you want to refund and click the Refund button on the _Actions_panel: A prompt asking you to confirm the refund appears, displaying details of the Credit Notes that will be created for the refund. Click Confirm . A Refundable Credit Note with details of the refund made will be available in the Credit Notes page. Note This option cannot be used to refund invoices that have been paid offline . You need to manually record such refunds in Chargebee. Once you make the refund the amount will be credited to the account that was used for the payment. If the refund is being made for a transaction that is not settled, then the transaction will simply be voided. Partial refunds are also not supported for transactions that are yet to be settled. Refunds are taken into account as separate transactions, and transaction charges may be applied. However, when a transaction is voided, it is not considered as a separate transaction. Refunds can only be made within a specific period of time from the date of the transaction. The period allowed for refund depends on the gateway that was used for the transaction. Reconciling Offline Refunds \u00b6 To reconcile the refunds that you have made offline, record them in Chargebee using the Record Refund option: You can use this option to record refunds that have been made via payment methods other than card such as cash, check, bank transfer, and so on. Click Record Refund to provide details of the refund, such as the amount, refund method, refund date, reference number. Provide comments and notes, if any. You can also record offline refunds using the 'record a refund' API . Partial and Full Refunds \u00b6 You can only refund up to the amount charged on the invoice. That is, you can make one or more partial refunds or a full refund against an invoice until you reach the total amount charged. Chargebee will not let you refund more than what is on the invoice. When refunding an invoice that also includes Promotional Credits, the amount to be returned to the card, and the amount added back to your customer's Promotional Credits balance will be calculated proportionately. Here is an example to illustrate: Example Total Invoice Amount: $30 Promotional Credits Adjusted: $10 Card Payment: $20 If you've entered \\(10 as the amount to be refunded, Chargebee (calculating in proportions) will assume that you want to return 50% of the card payment (\\) 20) to your customer. Chargebee will use 50% as a marker to refund the Promotional Credits in the invoice as well. Your refund of $10 will look like this: $10 returned to the card used to make the payment and $5 added back to customer's Promotional Credits balance. Adding Credits Instead of a Refund \u00b6 If you want to provide credits to your customer instead of a refund, you could create Credit Notes . This is quite useful in situations where you do not have to refund money to a customer, but you can provide credits that can be applied to the next invoice.

Payout operation \u00b6 It's a low-level operation that initiates a financial transaction in the defined payment provider using the specified payment method, it simply provides communication with an external provider and the mapping of statuses. It is also allowing to receive a processed payment amount that in some cases may be less rather than the initiated payment amount. Payout request operation \u00b6 Payout request is an operation with rich functionality to initiate a financial transaction due to the use of routing and exchange rate schemes. For example, this use enables to apply an exchange rate if a payout is made in the different currency then the currency of the deposit account where it is initiated from. The routing or failover conditions can be applied or changed using web interface in the in the appropriate Routing Scheme settings at the Dashboard. Those conditions will influence the selection of a deposit account from which a financial transaction will be initiated and the amount, which will be debited from this deposit account. Whensoever a payout request is initiated it creates at least one payout operation. For example, if a payout operation fails or 'split mode' is set then multiple payout operations may be created to finalise the payout request until the final status is obtained. All initiated requests are listed in the Payout Request page of Payout Gateway section. Payouts related to the certain payout request are listed in the Payout Request Payouts tab at the Request Overview page. Create a payout request \u00b6 To create the payout request, follow these steps: Create a payout point and set currencies of the payout point. Connect a certain payment provider ; Generate an API key . The API key does not expire. If an API is compromissed, you can revoke it and generate a new one. To add a currency of payout point, which is not listed in the drop down menu, then please write us a message to support@corefy.com to support this currency. A payout point currency is used mainly for accounting and reporting but you should specify at least one. The payout currency is a mandatory attribute ('point_currency') in a payout request, but it doesn't mean you can not initiate a financial transaction in the currency, which is different from the currency of the payout point. Corefy has a test mode you should use for testing. It operates separately from live mode , so you can make changes without affecting your live data. Using a test provider account it is possible only to initiate test payout requests. Payout and payment requests can be initiated from live deposit accounts only when you connect at least one provider, which supports payouts from the list of established integrations .

The benefits of the Payout Schemes using are: improved routing and fine-tune managing of route selection the possibility to configure a backup processing plan with the strategy cascade and the possibility to create the scheme of blockages that allows rejection of payouts based on transaction attributes You still can handle payout processing with old settings and use previously created payout routing schemes and payout rate schemes. Commerce scheme editing But we recommend to take your transaction routing to the next level as early as possible. Attention You should create different schemes for testing and performing live payout transactions. Test payout schemes are created and displayed only when you activate the test mode. Commerce scheme editing Create your first payout scheme \u00b6 Before you start Ensure you have a proper conversion scheme in the ' Rate Schemes ' . Create a new scheme if necessary. Find Payout Schemes tab in Payout Gateway section. Click on the Create button, specify the name of a new scheme and description (optional), choose rate scheme from the drop-down list. In the new scheme configuration, you can see automatically created routes for all services available to the organisation. All of them are enabled by default, and you can turn off those you don't plan to use. Configure routing \u00b6 The set of service schemes defines the routing in the payout scheme. To configure each of them, click on the corresponding row in the grid. A Routing Scheme is the main component for Payout Service Scheme. By default, it has optimal routing according to our system settings. Press the ' Replace by condition ' button to start editing the route and set the conditions for execution of the script. You can combine different conditions and groups of conditions; connect them using AND and OR operators. For illustration purposes, routing has a tree structure. Branches start from a node with conditions and end with a strategy, a set of strategies, or the following set of conditions. Green branches refer to meet conditions, red\u2014represent the state when conditions are not met. Set of strategies allows you to combine strategies (by balance, by weight) within a branch. The execution of strategies there depends on how they locate from top to bottom. Failover Failover is handled at Payout Request level by creating additional payouts if the previous ones were unsuccessful. This feature is set in the payout settings by the Attempts limit option if its value is above zero. In this case, the decision point component executes the routing scheme afresh. Still, the previous (unsuccessful) route is filtered, and routing returns the new route (or nothing) depending on the configuration. Therefore, for full use of failover, the result of conditions must be either a set of strategies or a strategy with multiple routes. And the number of strategies (or routes) in this branch should be equal to or exceed the given Attempts limit. If the strategy operates a p2p route, an additional p2p option section appears for it; they redefine p2p options from the payout route. Thus they can change the strategy of choosing p2p payouts depending on the transaction attributes. P2p Routing Strategies \u00b6 P2p options help you to customise the P2P routing as efficiently as possible. You can override the following options as part of the whole strategy. By default, p2p routes do not have priority over regular routes, but you can turn on the P2P firstly option in the payout processing settings for a Commerce account. Sorting: you can select the oldest transactions (that will soon be expired), biggest\u2014with the highest amount, and with the minimal remainder (the recent option is only relevant for routes with p2p payment splitting and, at the same time, turned-off splitting on payouts). Minimal amount: to select from p2p-pool transactions with amounts that are over or equal to the set value. Example calculation If you use a branch in a routing scheme for payouts of more than $10,000 and specify $5000 as a minimal amount , such transactions are split in at least $5000. Urgent period: if p2p transactions have an expiration date within this number of days, they will be taken first (the option interferes the primary sorting). Minimal remainder: after p2p splitting. Example calculation Let there are processed $100 payout, and the p2p pool has $130 and $140 payments, you choose to sort transactions by minimal remainders and select those with a minimal amount $35. Based on sorting settings, the components should take $130 payment, but in that case, the $30 rest will never be paid. So, you need to set 35 as the minimal remainder to split $140 payment on $100 and $40.

operates. What is a Payment Gateway? \u00b6 The main job of a payment gateway is to validate your customer\u2019s credit card details securely, make sure the funds are available for the payment and get you paid. A payment gateway is a service that authorizes credit card payments for online and offline businesses. It is the equivalent of a physical point of sale terminal in a shop or restaurant. It lets your customer submit their credit card details and then securely passes this sensitive financial information from the customer to the merchant and then between the merchant and the bank. The payment gateway then tells you whether the charge has been approved by the cardholder\u2019s bank and submits your charges for settlement. A settlement is where the payment amount is deducted from your customer\u2019s credit card account and deposited into your merchant account. What is a Merchant Account? \u00b6 Payment gateways are often confused with merchant accounts. To take payments online you need both a payment gateway and a merchant account. A merchant account is where funds are held before being deposited into your bank account. The role of the payment gateway is simply to decline or approve a transaction. Merchant accounts are the types of financial accounts that authorize merchants to accept payments online. These accounts are required if you want to use a payment gateway to process transactions from your website. Payment Service Providers \u00b6 What is a Payment Service Provider? \u00b6 Payment Service Providers (or PSPs) act as both a merchant account and the payment gateway, helping businesses to collect and manage their payments. Payments go to the PSP and are then transferred on to you. In details, a payment service provider ( PSP ) offers shops online services for accepting electronic payments by a variety of payment methods including credit card , bank-based payments such as direct debit , bank transfer , and real-time bank transfer based on online banking . Typically, a PSP can connect to multiple acquiring banks , card, and payment networks . In many cases, the PSP will fully manage these technical connections, relationships with the external network, and bank accounts. Furthermore, a full-service PSP can offer risk management services for card and bank-based payments, transaction payment matching, reporting, fund remittance and fraud protection in addition to multi-currency functionality and services. Some PSPs provide services to process other next-generation methods ( payment systems ) including cash payments, wallets, prepaid cards or vouchers, and even paper or e-check processing. Full-service payment service providers like Stripe , Braintree , PayPal , Adyen are typically easier and quicker to get started with as you don't need to set up your own merchant account (and if you do the provider will offer that too). What Payment providers does Corefy support? \u00b6 The platform supports all possible currencies, methods, flow and payment providers. A complete list of already implemented integrations with payment providers can be found here . There are more than 900 payment providers in the world. Even if you do not find the provider you are interested in, you can always request its implementation from us at any time. Currencies \u00b6 What is the currency? \u00b6 A currency , in the most specific sense is money in any form when in use or circulation as a medium of exchange , especially circulating banknotes and coins . A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use, especially for people in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars (US), pounds sterling (\u00a3), Australian dollars (A), European euros (\u20ac), Russian rubles (\u20bd) and Indian Rupees (\u20b9) are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized as stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets , which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. Currencies can be classified into two monetary systems : fiat money and commodity money , depending on what guarantees the currency's value. Digital currency has arisen with the popularity of computers and the Internet . Digital currencies \u00b6 Digital currency ( digital money , electronic money or electronic currency ) is a type of currency available in digital form (in contrast to physical, such as banknotes and coins ). It exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but can allow for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer-of-ownership. Examples include virtual currencies and cryptocurrencies and central bank issued money accounted for in a computer database (including digital base money ). Like traditional money , these currencies may be used to buy physical goods and services , but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game or social network. What currencies does Corefy support? \u00b6 In general, Corefy supports all the currencies in the world. This need is dictated by the fact that Corefy integrates various payment providers that can process any currency, including digital and crypto. A list of all supported currencies can be found in our currency directory . Payment and payout methods \u00b6 What is the payment method? \u00b6 The most common alternative payment methods are debit cards, charge cards , prepaid cards , direct debit , bank transfers, phone and mobile payments , checks , money orders and cash payments. More details can be found in the article on Wikipedia . Or take a look at a guide to payment methods . What difference between payment and payout methods? \u00b6 In general, there is no difference between payment methods and payments. This separation is necessary only for ease of identification. Payment methods used for payments in the payment gateway. Payouts, respectively. What methods does Corefy support? \u00b6 Supported by widespread access to high-speed internet and the insatiable appetite of customers for convenience, online commerce is progressing rapidly around the world and estimated to reach $4T (source: eMarketer) in 2020. But when it comes to payments online, businesses expanding internationally and taking advantage of the increased reach that online commerce provides them with are met with widely varying customer preferences. Not only can delivery terms be quite different (pay after delivery, for example, common in Europe and Asia, requires businesses to only expect payment once they\u2019ve shipped goods) but the payment methods used for online transactions themselves vary too. Credit and debit cards, not always the most trusted option, only account for half of the online transactions globally. Bank payments, digital wallets, and cash are in strong customer demand, and can even offer additional benefits to businesses such as lower risks and transaction costs. That's why, Corefy supports all the payment and payout methods implemented by payment providers that connected to our platform. A list of all supported currencies can be found in our payment and payout methods directory . Payment and payout services \u00b6 What are payment and payout services? \u00b6 This term is specifically introduced to identify methods in conjunction with currency. Often, payment providers use exactly the combination of method and currency. This allows you to accurately operate with one term for routing on the provider side, interacting with a single code, instead of two. Services include the properties and parameters required to initiate a payment or payout. This is like a contract for the gateway protocol. The gateway can always expect the parameters listed in the service properties. Example: If you need to make a payout, then obviously, for this you need to send some details based on service fields. For payout service to PayPal account by email, they look like this: { \"code\" : \"paypal_email_usd\" , \"method\" : \"paypal\" , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"amount_min\" : 0.01 , \"amount_max\" : 10000 , \"fields\" : [ { \"key\" : \"email\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"label\" : { \"en\" : \"Email\" , \"uk\" : \"\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0442\u0430\" }, \"hint\" : { \"en\" : \"Enter email\" , \"uk\" : \"\u0412\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0456\u0442\u044c \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0442\u0438\" }, \"regexp\" : \"/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&\u2019*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$\" , \"required\" : true , \"position\" : 1 } ] } What differences between payment and payout services? \u00b6 The only difference between the payment and payout services is that the payment service has flow property. Flow code determines the scenario of the payment processing. There are 4 basic payment processing flows: hpp \u2014 Hosted payment page. It is when a customer needs to be redirected to external HPP provided by Payment Service Provider . invoice \u2014 when a customer needs to pay by payment details. At the same time, the payment process outside the processing and asynchronous. This can be a manual transfer to a digital wallet, or bank Wire-transfer, or payment in a self-service kiosk by cash., etc. card \u2014 used for host-to-host card payment processing. Requires PCI DSS. test \u2014 used only for testing. What payment and payout services does Corefy support? \u00b6 First of all, the payment hub unifies the protocols and interaction with external payment providers. Therefore, it is necessary to have a single payment and payout service codes directory. The full directory is available here .

The payment gateway then tells you whether the charge has been approved by the cardholder\u2019s bank and submits your charges for settlement. A settlement is where the payment amount is deducted from your customer\u2019s credit card account and deposited into your merchant account.","title":"What is a Payment Gateway?"},{"location":"products/provider-hub/basic-concepts/#what-is-a-merchant-account","text":"Payment gateways are often confused with merchant accounts. To take payments online you need both a payment gateway and a merchant account. A merchant account is where funds are held before being deposited into your bank account. The role of the payment gateway is simply to decline or approve a transaction. Merchant accounts are the types of financial accounts that authorize merchants to accept payments online. These accounts are required if you want to use a payment gateway to process transactions from your website.","title":"What is a Merchant Account?"},{"location":"products/provider-hub/basic-concepts/#payment-service-providers","text":"","title":"Payment Service Providers"},{"location":"products/provider-hub/basic-concepts/#what-is-a-payment-service-provider","text":"Payment Service Providers (or PSPs) act as both a merchant account and the payment gateway, helping businesses to collect and manage their payments. Payments go to the PSP and are then transferred on to you. In details, a payment service provider ( PSP ) offers shops online services for accepting electronic payments by a variety of payment methods including credit card , bank-based payments such as direct debit , bank transfer , and real-time bank transfer based on online banking . Typically, a PSP can connect to multiple acquiring banks , card, and payment networks . In many cases, the PSP will fully manage these technical connections, relationships with the external network, and bank accounts. Furthermore, a full-service PSP can offer risk management services for card and bank-based payments, transaction payment matching, reporting, fund remittance and fraud protection in addition to multi-currency functionality and services. Some PSPs provide services to process other next-generation methods ( payment systems ) including cash payments, wallets, prepaid cards or vouchers, and even paper or e-check processing. Full-service payment service providers like Stripe , Braintree , PayPal , Adyen are typically easier and quicker to get started with as you don't need to set up your own merchant account (and if you do the provider will offer that too).","title":"What is a Payment Service Provider?"},{"location":"products/provider-hub/basic-concepts/#what-payment-providers-does-corefy-support","text":"The platform supports all possible currencies, methods, flow and payment providers.

These various currencies are recognized as stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets , which determine the relative values of the different currencies.

But when it comes to payments online, businesses expanding internationally and taking advantage of the increased reach that online commerce provides them with are met with widely varying customer preferences. Not only can delivery terms be quite different (pay after delivery, for example, common in Europe and Asia, requires businesses to only expect payment once they\u2019ve shipped goods) but the payment methods used for online transactions themselves vary too. Credit and debit cards, not always the most trusted option, only account for half of the online transactions globally. Bank payments, digital wallets, and cash are in strong customer demand, and can even offer additional benefits to businesses such as lower risks and transaction costs.

We start our 2021 with routing and processing updates, so in these brief notes, you can look through the most relevant of them. But firstly, the important news: Be aware From February 2, 2021, we start to send in the Callbacks an additional parameter auth_type . Thus, it allows identifying which flow the transaction was managed by. This will not affect existing integrations, but if you want to obtain information about the authentication types, you should add the relevant parameter to your Callback handlers. Highlights \u00b6 Payout Schemes optimisation : at payout splitting, the system examines routes' limits and remaining amounts for each following parts Manual card transaction handling Other fixes and improvements In the Details \u00b6 Payout Schemes Update \u00b6 Our dev team fixed an issue when the remaining amount after payout splitting on peer-to-peer routes was lower than the minimum amount limit and could not be paid. So now, the system examines routes' limits and remaining amounts for each following parts to choose the optimal alternative. And the last payout is sent: by a p2p route within amount limits, or with the remaining amount by a non-p2p route if no feasible p2p route is found. Card Gate Update \u00b6 Good news to your support engineers! We added the option for manual correction of transaction statuses. And, if for any reason you find differences between card transaction statuses at PayCore.io log system and payment provider information, you can use the '+ Add transaction' button to fix that. You can indicate that the amount has been partially refunded (partially processed or charged back), update description, add the provider's original transaction ID, approval code, or RRN. And at setting status fail , or expired , you can choose the proper resolution. Fixes and Improvements \u00b6 Also, there were a few little bugs that caused troubles as bugs usually do. We fixed them, and everything is going better.

As you may have probably aware, we changed our release flow approach, so the platform's minor versions have been launched more frequently. And today's notes feature all the improvements you can find in our last updates. Let's sum up our January advances! Highlights \u00b6 Payment Gateway updates : added fee set for chargebacks to Commerce payment services' options and Provider Reference ID parameter to payment flow Card Gateway update : security updates, increased HPP theme options limit, updated browser_ip regular expression to support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses And other platform performance improvements List of Changes \u00b6 Payment Gateway Updates \u00b6 New Payment services' options: added fee set for chargebacks \u00b6 In addition to the already familiar Commerce settings, now we provide the opportunity to configure fees for chargeback procedure. Thus, you can use them to recompense possible penalty fees from acquirers. Chargeback Fees are available to configure for the card payment services, as well as ApplePay, GooglePay, and Masterpass. To do so, go to the 'Commerce' settings \u2192 'Payments': 'Payment services' , select the desired one, and specify fee values. But we certainly wish you have fewer consumer chargebacks and disputes associated with your accounts. Provider Reference ID parameter \u00b6 We found that some providers do not accept our Reference ID format, for example, have various additional requirements to this parameter, such as length or characters used. Hence, we added an extra attribute 'Provider Reference ID' to generate and send ID according to their requirements (but in the vast majority of cases, this field will remain empty). It is important to recall that Provider Reference IDs may be the same for different providers due to their generation restrictions. Therefore, to search and check transaction data, use the Reference IDs unique throughout our system. Card Gateway Updates \u00b6 Card Gateway HPP security update \u00b6 We made several updates related to the HPP status page and redirect security scope. From now on, we set an additional cookie with payment context when a user submits the payment form. We also should recall that after the invoice expiry, the status page becomes inaccessible to any user. But in any case If we have gained the ACS data, we process them and pass to the acquirer to finalise the transaction. Increased HPP theme options limit \u00b6 The possibility to customise the Hosted Payment Page design with theme options was so convenient for you that we have raised its limit again: up to 50 options. Find and edit the ' Theme options ' in ' Commerce ' settings \u2192 ' Card Gateway options ' \u2192 ' HPP ': Updated a regular expression for the browser_ip \u00b6 We also enlarged a regular expression for the browser_ip attribute of the browser_info object to support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses' format.

Firstly, we would like to announce essential changes in transaction creation within an organisation. Be aware The update will affect transfers, deposits, and withdrawals from June 8, 2021 . The main change is an added stage for confirmation. After creation, go to the transaction entry, process or terminate it, or ask your team member with the appropriate access. And we've already expanded the access scope related to handling transactions that affect the Commerce balances. Find out more in the Organisation settings section and revise your team members' access if necessary. The following videos compare the current one-step and updated two-step flow of deposit creation Current version Updated version And let's now turn to the enhancements that our dev team has prepared over the past month. Highlights \u00b6 Commerce updates : expanded access settings for commerce accounts and operations, added merchant_profile object to the Commerce settings and request creation and options to control Saved cards access scope Connectors Hub update : updated the Callback handler, added payouts array to Callback for payouts processing, added the Deposit account option for preventing finalising payout transactions with failure resolutions Card Gateway update : added modifier by card status to Payment schemes Reports optimising Receipt Addon update : receipts generating for Payout invoices List of changes \u00b6 Commerce updates \u00b6 Expanded access settings \u00b6 We've made the Organisation setup more flexible and divided the default access scope for commerce account and operation management into permissions to view (read) and edit (write). Check and assign roles and permissions at the Dashboard ( Administration \u2192 Organisation settings \u2192 Access control: Access roles ). Merchant profile for processing \u00b6 We added the merchant_profile object to commerce properties that contains information about the merchant company. The Corefy platform adds the object during payment and payout requests creation, and the data is sent unchanged to payment service providers if they require it for recording and processing. Get this data through API request, update in the Dashboard Commerce settings ( Commerce accounts \u2192 General: Profile ). Sample code of Commerce account data attributes \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"commerce-accounts\" , \"id\" : \"coma_Bb1erfDTYzivNSp\" , \"attributes\" : { \"merchant_profile\" : { \"company_name\" : \"Best Docs Store\" , \"mcc\" : \"5942\" , \"company_address\" : \"1 Canada Square\" , \"city\" : \"London\" , \"website_url\" : \"https://lets.doc.it\" } } } Edit in the Dashboard Commerce settings Similar parameters in the cardgate_options object for host-to-host payments will be deprecated. So, if you filled in the Card Gateway options, we will copy them to the merchant_profile with subsequent updates. Share Saved card tokens between Commerce accounts \u00b6 Another new option is allowing sharing tokens for saved card numbers between accounts. In so doing, accounts for sharing need to have a simple ledger scheme, and you can choose several ones from the drop-down list in the Commerce settings. Suppose a customer previously used the 'Remember me' checkbox on the Checkout of the commerce account that has the option enabled. Consequently, they will see their cards when visiting the Checkout pages of accounts to which tokens were shared and save time filling in the payment form. But notice that if you stop sharing saved tokens between accounts, new cards won't be saved, but choosing old ones will remain available for users. Connectors Hub updates \u00b6 Callback handler update \u00b6 Analysing interaction with various providers, we encountered that part of them doesn't sign notifications with a unique signature. Such messages we couldn't validate and needed additional tools to make sure that the received data is accurate. So we've updated the callback handler and made the pull statement's request sent as soon as we receive such an 'unsigned' callback message. This allows faster reconciliation and further processing of the transaction. Updated Callbacks for payout invoices \u00b6 The use of the splitting tool is often helpful during transaction routing. But it also creates complications for analysis and efficiency estimating. To assist in collecting data into which parts the transaction was divided and receiving statuses and resolutions for each of them, we've added a payouts attribute whose value contains an array of objects with separate payouts data for reconciliation responses and Callbacks for finalised payout invoices. By default, you get information only about the successfully processed parts. And suppose you need to collect more complete data, including failed to process amounts and provider IDs, code, resolution, payload etc., of each part. In that case, you can turn on the Expose internal data option in the payout processing settings. Sample of the Callback code with the payouts array { \"data\" :{ \"id\" : \"cpoi_ztg1119SQjlAk1Y2\" , \"type\" : \"payout-invoices\" , \"attributes\" :{ \"fee\" : 0 , \"amount\" : 1000 , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"fields\" :[], \"status\" : \"processed\" , \"payouts\" :[ { \"id\" : \"po_4a3Bgz6YR3cRjW6k\" , // a u n ique transa c t io n ID \"rrn\" : null , // Re tr ieval Re feren ce Number , a value is op t io nal \"amount\" : 725 , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"status\" : \"processed\" // a f i nal processi n g s tatus o f t he par t }, { \"id\" : \"po_3cR4z6kgYR6aj3BW\" , \"rrn\" : null , \"amount\" : 275 , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"status\" : \"processed\" } ] } } } If the Expose internal data option enabled { \"data\" :{ \"id\" : \"cpoi_ztg1119SQjlAk1Y2\" , \"type\" : \"payout-invoices\" , \"attributes\" :{ \"fee\" : 0 , \"amount\" : 1000 , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"fields\" :[], \"status\" : \"process_failed\" , \"payouts\" :[ { \"id\" : \"po_4a3Bgz6YR3cRjW6k\" , // a u n ique transa c t io n ID \"rrn\" : null , // Re tr ieval Re feren ce Number \"amount\" : 725 , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"status\" : \"process_failed\" , // a f i nal processi n g s tatus o f t he par t \"payload\" : [], // addi t io nal i nf o fr om PSP \"provider_id\" : \"po_16qdUPN2sUkrNtLp_external_id\" , // a transa c t io n ID i n t he provider da ta base \"provider_code\" : \"test\" , // a transa c t io n provider code \"resolution\" : \"invalid_details\" // a n origi nal error code }, { \"id\" : \"po_3cR4z6kgYR6aj3BW\" , \"rrn\" : null , \"amount\" : 275 , \"status\" : \"process_failed\" , \"payload\" :[], \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"resolution\" : \"invalid_details\" , \"provider_id\" : \"po_1krNdUPN2sULpt6q_external_id\" , \"provider_code\" : \"test\" } ] } } } Find the Expose internal data option in the Commerce payouts settings Deposit accounts improving \u00b6 Prevent a failure status is an extra option for Deposit accounts, preventing finalising payout transactions that obtain failure status (for example, due to data transport errors). If you enable it, such transactions get the pending status and the moderation_required label and wait for manual statement reconciliation and assignment of the actual status. Card Gate update \u00b6 We added the Card status attribute for payments' modifier schemes. It accesses your organisation card vault and assumes values like: new expired verified unverified verify_failed Reports optimising \u00b6 We've revised the reports generation process and made it far less resource-intensive and therefore faster. What else to add: it\u2019s just a necessary job. Addons update \u00b6 And good news for Receipt Addon users: the Corefy platform starts supporting receipt generation for Payout invoices. The principle of use is the same as for Payment invoices, but you can set another template for this type of transactions. Bug fixes \u00b6 Lastly, we've successfully improved our products' performance and resolved revealed bug issues.

This month our dev team has focused on optimising the transaction flow, among other things, updated handling and finalising the user authentication process (and has prepared a few more updates that we'd like to share). We've updated the white list of our IP addresses and specially mentioned those that will be deprecated soon. So check it out to update the relevant IP lists wherever they are needed. Highlights \u00b6 Commerce update : implemented two-step transactions within an organisation Gateways updates : detailed charged back amounts and fees, added an option for the card validation field on the default HPP, and new metrics for card payment routing Customers section's updates : added options to control payments and payouts availability in the customer entry and two extra columns in the transactional report tables for the customers' data and metadata Added an extra table for Analytics queries Minor dashboard layout update Performance improvements and bug fixes. List of changes \u00b6 Commerce update \u00b6 An additional stage for confirmation of transactions within an organisation \u00b6 As we announced in the previous notes , we've updated transfers, deposits and withdrawals processing. Therefore, you should further review and confirm (or decline) prepared transactions within your organisation\u2014or ask your teammates with relevant access about it. Gateways updates \u00b6 Charged back amounts and fees are detailed \u00b6 The reconciliation process has become a bit more informative because we added charged_back_amount as a parameter to the API scheme for the Payment invoices, Payment requests, and Payments. It's also obtainable in Callbacks for payment invoices. And besides, charged back amounts and charged back fees are detailed in report and export tables. Charged back amounts and fees in the export table Code sample of the Payment invoice Callback { \"data\" :{ \"type\" : \"payment-invoices\" , \"id\" : \"cpi_i1T5VQhj5IbHHI1P\" , \"attributes\" :{ \"status\" : \"charged_back\" , \"serial_number\" : \"i1T5VQhj5IbHHI1P\" , \"resolution\" : \"ok\" , \"moderation_required\" : false , \"amount\" : 55 , \"payment_amount\" : 55 , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"service_currency\" : \"USD\" , \"reference_id\" : \"Test Order #d49a4e0da458\" , \"test_mode\" : true , \"description\" : \"Vendor 1\" , \"descriptor\" : null , \"fee\" : 0 , \"deposit\" : 55 , \"processed\" : 1622799052 , \"processed_amount\" : 55 , \"refunded_amount\" : null , \"processed_fee\" : 0 , \"processed_deposit\" : 55 , \"metadata\" :[], \"flow_data\" :[], \"flow\" : \"hpp\" , \"payment_flow\" : \"charge\" , \"return_url\" : \"https://example.com\" , \"return_urls\" :[], \"callback_url\" : \"https://example.com\" , \"created\" : 1622799042 , \"updated\" : 1622799067 , \"payload\" :[], \"original_data\" :[], \"rrn\" : null , \"approval_code\" : null , \"reserved_amount\" : null , \"reserve_expires\" : null , \"unreserved\" : null , \"source\" : \"platform_dashboard\" , \"callback_logs\" :[], \"charged_back_amount\" : 55 }, \"relationships\" :[], \"links\" :[] }, \"included\" :[ { \"type\" : \"payment-requests\" , \"id\" : \"prq_5ww1QATNAFv9LA7m\" , \"attributes\" :{ \"amount\" : 55 , \"paid_amount\" : 55 , \"amount_readonly\" : true , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"reference_id\" : \"cpi_i1T5VQhj5IbHHI1P\" , \"status\" : \"CHARGED_BACK\" , \"description\" : \"Vendor 1\" , \"test_mode\" : true , \"expires\" : 1622802631 , \"created\" : 1622799042 , \"processed\" : 1622799052 , \"return_url\" : \"https://com.paycore.io/return?id=cpi_i1T5VQhj5IbHHI1P\" , \"callback_url\" : \"https://example.com\" , \"resolution\" : \"OK\" , \"payment_service\" : null , \"metadata\" :{ \"fee\" : \"0.00\" , \"fee_strategy\" : \"external\" }, \"fields\" :[], \"charged_back_amount\" : 55 }, \"relationships\" :[] }, { \"type\" : \"customers\" , \"id\" : \"cus_HF0o1mHSWKzFEbCg\" , \"attributes\" :{ \"reference_id\" : \"test\" , \"email\" : \"test@test.com\" , \"name\" : \"Test Customer\" , \"phone\" : \"44 20 7234 3456\" , \"description\" : \"A test user for test transactions\" , \"created\" : 1593120883 , \"metadata\" :[], \"avatar\" : \"\" , \"archived\" : false , \"processing_options\" :{ \"payment_enabled\" : true , \"payout_enabled\" : true } }, \"relationships\" :{ \"commerce-account\" :{ \"data\" :{ \"type\" : \"commerce-accounts\" , \"id\" : \"coma_FoXWOaBSEnUpvP4I\" } } } } ] } Default HPP (Checkout) theme update \u00b6 We've added a card_number_length option for validation of the card number field. You can use it with the default HPP theme if you allow entering card numbers with a length different from 16 digits (by default). The card_number_length option can obtain two mutually exclusive parameters: range \u2014an object with min and max keys and integer values for a range from the lowest to the highest value; allowedNumbers \u2014an array to list possible integer values. A range from the lowest to the highest value \"card_number_length\" :{ \"range\" :{ \"min\" : 12 , \"max\" : 18 } A particular quantity of digits \"card_number_length\" :{ \"allowedNumbers\" :[ 14 , 16 , 18 ] } You can send HPP options via the Private API or set them up in the dashboard: Commerce section \u2192 Card Gateway : Options \u2192 HPP . New metrics for card payment routing \u00b6 We've started collecting additional figures about card payments for the entire period of running the card vault, and now you can use them as conditions in payment routing schemes: Card successful payments counts the number of successful payments by a card; Card all payments numbers all payments by a card; Card turnover calculates the total amount of successful payments by a card in the transaction currency. Customers section's updates \u00b6 New options to manage customers' profiles \u00b6 We've added options to control payments and payouts availability for a customer. Therefore, added the check whether the related option is enabled before processing the transaction. Both options are enabled by default, so you should find and edit a customer entry to block specified transaction types. Customers' data in transactional reports \u00b6 From now on, there are two extra columns in the transactional report tables for the customers' data and metadata from the related Dashboard entries. We're sure that it comes in handy for sorting and analysing transactions. Example Analytics update \u00b6 We've added an extra table for Analytics queries that deals with the organisation database. The pa_accounts table displays the data only from the card vault now, but we plan to extend it with other account types like cryptocurrency or mobile money wallets later. However, formatting queries with data from the table consider that we don't display sensitive user data (such as card numbers etc.) or hide them by masks. Dashboard layout update \u00b6 A minor update may be brought to the attention: we've changed counters in the Payout Schemes section. Now they display the numbers of all linked schemes without splitting them into enabled and disabled. This data just wasn't informative for our users, so we removed it to increase the page loading speed. Performance Improvements \u00b6 We've made various bug fixes, and now our products are better than they were.

List of changes \u00b6 Commerce updates \u00b6 We've updated the Commerce settings and added the company_phone and country_code (for ISO 3166-1 numeric format) parameters to the merchant_profile object that can be transmitted to providers during transactions processing. merchant_profile code sample { \"company_name\" : \"Best Docs Store\" , \"mcc\" : \"5942\" , \"company_address\" : \"1 Canada Square\" , \"city\" : \"London\" , \"website_url\" : \"https://lets.doc.it\" , \"company_phone\" : \"447911123456\" , \"country_code\" : \"826\" } API updates \u00b6 We've extended the feasibility of Platform API and added endpoints for handling transactions that affect the Commerce balances: /deposits /deposits/{id} /deposits/{id}/process /deposits/{id}/terminate /withdrawals /withdrawals/{id} /withdrawals/{id}/process /withdrawals/{id}/terminate /transfers /transfers/{id} /transfers/{id}/process /transfers/{id}/terminate Allowed methods : GET, POST Using these endpoints, you can obtain information about transactions within the organisation, create, and process or terminate them if you have related access rights. Card Gate updates \u00b6 OTP flow for card payments \u00b6 We continue enhancing card payments processing and have added the OTP flow for transactions through Card Gateway. Suppose an acquirer requests an additional user verification step by passing an OTP test. In that case, it allows the merchant's website to display the verification page, and the user completes the card authentication process by entering a one-time password there without redirecting. That makes steps of processing fewer and completes the transaction process faster. Allow using saved cards from another commerce account option \u00b6 Minor changes in the commerce settings' layout: we've moved the Allow to use saved cards option from the General profile page to the Card Gateway: Options . Routing updates \u00b6 We've extended the list of attributes for payout scheme conditions. For them, we examine the total number of peer-to-peer transactions performed through this service as well as successful and failed ones. So pick one of the related attributes to compare with integers and set up the scheme. Addons management \u00b6 We've expanded possibilities to manage addons, in particular, added functions to connect newly available ones. Besides that, you can edit already established addons, make them enabled in your organisation and set up IP Whitelist. Add a new addon Edit the addon's settings Good news for our Ukrainian clients who use the NBU transactions registration addon . To make it more user-friendly, we've added all registered transactions to a separate section. It displays short data about transaction entries and allows filtering them by main parameters. Finally, we've revised approaches to providing access to addons within organisations. Now we configure them during an organisation set-up. And you can contact your account manager to connect any addons as necessary, considering that the related dashboard section doesn't display the complete ready list.

This major release introduces new functionality and improvements. It\u2019s often helpful to know what\u2019s happening under the hood because it gives you insight into things you cannot see. Thus in this document, we will give a brief overview of the highlights of this release. Summary \u00b6 v0.56 comes with a new platform layer above the Payment and Payout Gateways in which we centralised the common functionality and services for ecommerce for both online business and FinTech customers. This is a fundamental architectural restructuring which hugely simplifies and standardises the interaction and operation of your payment infrastructure in Corefy. Major ecommerce services now are taken care of within the Commerce layer and no longer from within each Payment and Payout Gateways, making integration and interaction a much easier and leaner process. List of changes \u00b6 Commerce feature New UI/UX Navigation changes Organisation Settings changes User Profile changes API updates Performance improvements Commerce feature \u00b6 Commerce Account Instead of having multiple Corefy accounts to support various projects or business entities now you can create as many Commerce Accounts as you require within one Corefy account. When it comes to running multiple businesses now you can manage them all in one place. For our FinTech and marketplace customers, this means an ability to create accounts for their merchants and manage them in one place. Currency Accounts With Currency Accounts now is possible to create and manage currency holding accounts that give your merchants the flexibility to make and receive foreign currency payments in selected currencies without converting the funds into a base currency. For online businesses, multiple currency accounts enable to support billing in multiple currencies and consolidate transaction data made in the same currency for accounting and financial management purposes. Contract Schemes Contract Schemes are to create a set of rules comprises routing and FX-rate schemes for both ingoing and outgoing transactions in supported currencies. You need to create first a contract scheme before you'll be able to create a Commerce Account. This is due to requiring that every commerce account has linked to a certain Contract Scheme. Online businesses can create multiple Contract Schemes to be assigned to numerous Commerce Accounts to support different types of offerings or multiple storefronts. The ability to assign one Contract Scheme to any number of Commerce Accounts allows FinTechs and marketplaces to apply the same conditions mirror agreement conditions to a certain group of merchants (i.g. toy retailers or ticketing) such as available payment methods, commissions, reserves, and etc. Payment and Payout Invoice There are three types of transactions that occur in Corefy: invoice, request and payment or payout. A Payment or Payout is a low-level operation that initiates a financial transaction in the defined payment provider using the specified payment method, it simply provides communication with an external provider and the mapping of statuses. A Payment or Payout Request is an operation with rich functionality that initiates one or many payments or payouts depending on the conditions set in the routing and exchange rate schemes. A Payment Invoice or Payout Invoice is a high-level operation that initiates not only payment or payout request correspondingly but also Ledger account transactions. An invoice includes information on a currency, commission and exchange rate. This new functionality allows online businesses to apply commission fee for all incoming and outgoing transactions separately for every Commerce Account. For example, Uber and Fiverr take a 20% commission rate, while Freelancer charges 10% per transaction. Transaction fees are usually the main revenue stream of any payment processor. Ledger feature: taking every penny into account For Corefy users with a limited accounting background, the Ledger feature can appear to be the most foreign part of the platform. The Ledger screen actually includes all aspects of the accounting record and based in double-entry bookkeeping: in order for an amount to be presented in one account, it must also be present in another account, hence the use of debits and credits. It is an extremely valuable tool in accounting and financial management when it comes to payment processing for third parties. Corefy allows for quick processing of accounting information \u2018behind the scenes\u2019. The Ledger activities of a business are all captured in Corefy, through the summation of all Transactions by particular Account the cash flowed to and from. Each account has an account Category which determines where the account appears in your financial statements. We enable you adding or editing Categories those are divided into active and passive. Ledger feature is available for customers on Corefy Commerce plan, you can upgrade at any time to use this functionality. It worth to mention that Ledger feature can be enabled for any Commerce Account when required to take into account the cash flows through the commerce account. Ledger: new types of transactions New types of Ledger transactions are: Deposits Withdrawals Transfers These new Ledger transaction types are required to take into account the financial transactions made outside Corefy and can be initiated manually at the moment. Info Read more about Commerce Look and feel: New UI/UX \u00b6 We\u2019ve started refreshing Corefy \u2019s UI some time ago, and Corefy v0.56 brings another wave of changes in this area. This time, we\u2019ve focused on improving the Payment Gateway and Payout Gateway screens supported by the recent release of Commerce functionality. Both payments and payouts requests or transactions are the most commonly used lists, and we always aim at making your time spent with Corefy more enjoyable and productive. Navigation changes \u00b6 Payments and Payouts moved to Payment Gateway and Payout Gateway sections correspondingly. Now it is more intuitive for identifying where to go for details. Screenshots Show test data key moved to the bottom of the main menu, which is used to toggle between Live and Test data. Screenshots Operations screen now includes 5 brand new tabs: Payment Invoices Payout Invoices Deposit Withdrawals Transfers Screenshots Every tab will provide a list of transactions with regard to their origins. Organisation Settings changes \u00b6 We've added setting organisation level Preferences and Callbacks screens in the Organisation Settings Screenshots User Profile changes \u00b6 The User Profile Sessions are long-lived but now we added the screen with the list of all active sessions. They can be viewed and revoked from the User Profile Sessions page. Screenshots The User Profile Auditlog screen shows a timeline of the types of activities that have happened to this User Profile over time. The Auditlog is always shown in reverse chronological order (newest first) with an external IP address for every activity. Screenshots Current activities being logged include: Security changes - password reset request or change, two-factor authentication enable or disable. Profile changes - any overrides or changes to user profile information. Preferences changes - changes to user-specific preferences such as localisation, date, time and number formats. Info Get more information about the User Profile Auditlog API Updates and changes for developers \u00b6 The latest Corefy version is chalked full of changes in everything from the user experience to under the programming hood. Along with the new Commerce and Ledger features, we have also released a new round of public and private APIs to support those products. The all-new Commerce and Ledger groups of endpoints have been released into production to support new functionality. In this release, we have introduced dozens of new endpoints in the Public API Now every Commerce Account has its own Commerce Private API that opens parts of backend data and application functionality within that commerce account. As well every Commerce Account has the Commerce Public API that allows external service access. Those new APIs were introduced to satisfy the requirements for the Account Information Service (AIS) and Payment Initiation Service (PIS) elements of the EU's revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). If you're among our FinTech customers such as ewallet or cryptocurrency exchange, there's no need to worry about compliance with the legislative requirements for APIs. Performance improvements \u00b6 We also made general performance improvements, aesthetic corrections and various bug fixes.","title":"v0.56 (05/03/2019)"},{"location":"release-notes/archive/2019/v0.56/#corefy-v056-march-4-2019","text":"By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer Hello all, we have released a new version ( v0.56 ) of Corefy .

We are currently still in the process of migrating existing customers to the new PayCore.io Commerce, which was recently released and fixing some previously unknown issues. Our frontend dev team is testing PayCore.io Commerce Batch Payouts user interfaces and other new features, which we hope to release in the coming week, so stay tuned for that. List of changes \u00b6 API Update: Batch Payouts Merchant SDK.js Improvements and Bug fixes New API endpoints for Batch Payouts \u00b6 Batch Payouts enables you to simultaneously send payouts to an unlimited amount of recipients by creating an array of batch payout items. Each Payout Item has information on the amount, currency and service will be used to make a payout. So, you can initiate payouts using multiple payouts methods simultaneously, e.g. a mix of SEPA and SWIFT transfers, Visa OCT and Mastercard MoneySend services, and PayPal wallets both by account number and phone. So, there are no limits on the number of recipients or payout methods. Batch Payout Items are simply mirroring Payout Request functionality but can be verified by PayCore.io prior to the processing. Batch Payout has its own workflow. Concurrently, Batch Payout and Batch Payout Items have different statues than Payout Request or simple Payout. More information can be found in the Documentation and the API Reference. Commerce Public API Client \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 We\u2019ve recently released PayCore.io Commerce Public API . Commerce Public API Client simplifies creating custom payment pages for your checkout. Since every Commerce Account has its own public API key, you'll be able to have custom payment pages to support different types of offerings or multiple storefronts or create commerce accounts for your merchants, when it comes to payment service. How it works \u00b6 With the JavaScript library, you can send a pre-request for both Payments and Payouts and design your own payment page to show available services and payment methods for a particular currency and amount (in case of Payouts). By knowing payment and payout methods, you can list them in your checkout as payment or payout options that user can choose from. In the same time, you'll get information about payment requisites required to process a payment or payout for every service. The term 'Service' means a combination of payment or payout method and currency. By knowing available services, you get the freedom of choice to process a Payment Invoice in the currency you wish the funds to be settled. For outgoing transactions, this means an ability for your user to choose from available currencies. So now, you have all the tools you need to create a 'choice' and 'details' screens or steps for your payment page. When a user made a choice of the payment or payout method and entered the required details, you can use information about available services to create a Payment or Payout Request with a particular service. Take into account that Payout Invoices can either be processed in the currency of the Payout Invoice or the Service currency. The response to the Payout Pre-request will also include the exchange rate to be used for processing the Payout Invoice and the transaction fee. You can get information on the exchange rate and the transaction fee for incoming transactions only when you'll create a Payment Invoice. Due to the requirements of the EU's revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), a Payment Service Provider (PSP) must provide information on all charges payable by the payment service user to the PSP, including interest and exchange rates. So, when you'll get this information for the payment, you're able to provide it to comply with the PSD2 requirements. New option to test your integration \u00b6 In order to test your integration, you only need to select a preferred currency to test this code without a need to replace the actual Public API key through your Commerce Account SDK Sandbox screen. Performance improvements and bug fixes \u00b6 We also made general performance improvements and various bug fixes. Trademarks: SWIFT, Visa, PayPal and Mastercard Moneysend are trade names, trade marks or registered trade marks of their respective holders.","title":"v0.57 (11/03/2019)"},{"location":"release-notes/archive/2019/v0.57/#paycoreio-v057-march-11-2019","text":"By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer Hello all, here is an update on what the dev team has been working on the last week.

When a user made a choice of the payment or payout method and entered the required details, you can use information about available services to create a Payment or Payout Request with a particular service. Take into account that Payout Invoices can either be processed in the currency of the Payout Invoice or the Service currency. The response to the Payout Pre-request will also include the exchange rate to be used for processing the Payout Invoice and the transaction fee. You can get information on the exchange rate and the transaction fee for incoming transactions only when you'll create a Payment Invoice. Due to the requirements of the EU's revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), a Payment Service Provider (PSP) must provide information on all charges payable by the payment service user to the PSP, including interest and exchange rates. So, when you'll get this information for the payment, you're able to provide it to comply with the PSD2 requirements.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"release-notes/archive/2019/v0.57/#new-option-to-test-your-integration","text":"In order to test your integration, you only need to select a preferred currency to test this code without a need to replace the actual Public API key through your Commerce Account SDK Sandbox screen.","title":"New option to test your integration"},{"location":"release-notes/archive/2019/v0.57/#performance-improvements-and-bug-fixes","text":"We also made general performance improvements and various bug fixes.

We keep working to improve our product, and here is an update on what our dev team has been achieving in the last week. Summer is going to end soon, and in hindsight, we were more than efficient in the integration of new connectors and technologies this season. Now is the time to focus on support and system enhancements. Highlights \u00b6 Payment Retry feature is added : to retry incomplete or refused payments without leaving the payment page Commerce improvements : added a dynamic descriptor to the payment Integrations Update : supporting new features Bug fixes . A batch of irritating bugs was found and cleared! All Updates \u00b6 Payment Retry Feature \u00b6 The most common reasons for card payments declines are incorrect card number or expiration date, insufficient funds, acquirers fraud rules blocked the transaction, including based on customer's location. Usually, customers can solve these problems quickly and continue the payment. Payment Retry Feature allows your customers to enter or update payment information, and to retry the incomplete or refused payment without leaving the payment page. If the payment cannot be processed due to some error, the resulting page displays the error that occurred along with an explanation. It helps to understand the problem and the ways to solve it. Dynamic Descriptor \u00b6 The descriptor is the text that your customer sees on their bank account statement. We added the possibility to generate the descriptor with e.g. an order number for improved customer service and recognisability. The more recognisable your descriptor is, the less risk you have of receiving disputes (e.g. chargebacks). Go to the Commerce section \u2192 Commerce accounts settings \u2192 Payment options / Payout options \u2192 Descriptor template . Use order parameters in braces to add their values to the template. The Dynamic Descriptor feature is currently available for Decta, CardPay, and Fondy. We're working to extend the list.

Commerce Hosted Payment Page \u00b6 It's now possible to integrate a hosted payment page on any client using a specially designed widget, or simply pass the link for payment to your client. Everything you need is a public API key of the commerce account along with some invoice data the will be created. Before taking your integration live, make sure that your application is tested thoroughly in the Sandbox. You can enter our dashboard to play with settings and parameters in the Sandbox and to get a feel for your hosted payment page experience before completing your integration. Also, you may use our JavaScript widget for building payment flows in different environments with a few clicks by simply copying the configured look and feel from the Sandbox to initiate a payment page. CardGate \u00b6 CardGate is now available in the main menu. The list of payment request with included lists of payments and transaction has been added. CardGate's and acquirers' transaction IDs along with their appropriate business IDs are listed in every payment and can be found in the Dashboard.

Manual Statements (Both Payment and Payout Gateways ) . Now you can manually change the status of a payout transaction to 'Success' or 'Fail'.

By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer Cheery PayCore.io greetings to all of you! It's time for Version 1.10 now! We updated approach to publication our release notes We changed notes' frequency, linked them with release dates of the platform's major and minor versions and skipped patch versions. Mostly, our dev team releases updates every second Wednesday in the evening so that you may wait for information about the latest news on the same day. The main upgrade of this release is the ledger division. Early, we faced the problem when a massive flow of activities in one commerce account might block transactions throughout the organisation account. We have eliminated it when separated ledger processes on commerce accounts. That eased the burden on the system and increased the general performance of our platform. To know about other updates, check the list below. Highlights \u00b6 Card Gate upgrade : added flow for card verification Commerce improvements : added possibility to set up Callbacks' options, filtered archived currency accounts Dashboard betterment : expanded information about payment Performance improvements List of Changes \u00b6 Verify Flow \u00b6 Card verification allows you to accept, tokenise, and verify a cardholder's payment information without actually billing the customer for a charge. It is especially useful if you're offering a trial period for a product or service, or if you give your users the possibility to link their cards with the application. After authorising, the card payment is not complete until capturing. So, in Verify Flow, payment with the verification request will be voided and won't affect your balances. Commerce Improvements \u00b6 We moved callbacks' options to the separate section in the Commerce settings. Also, we added the possibility to set up delays between Callbacks' requests and the number of attempts to receive the final status of the payment invoice. Additionally, you can avoid receiving unnecessary messages in Callbacks by toggling the \"Only final\" statuses option. And another minor commerce update: we no longer displayed currency accounts that linked with archived commerce accounts. If you require information about them, unarchive the related commerce account. Expanded Transaction Overview \u00b6 We added Flow Data, Original Data, and Integration sections to the payment invoice overview (and you know what to do with them). Performance Improvements \u00b6 We have successfully improved our products' performance, identified and effectively fixed various types of bugs. Stay tuned for the next updates!","title":"v1.10 (11/03/2020)"},{"location":"release-notes/archive/2020/v1.10/#paycoreio-v110-march-11-2020","text":"By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer Cheery PayCore.io greetings to all of you!

After implementation, you can find a list of all enabled addons and general information about them and linked accounts in the provider hub section ( Connected Accounts \u2192 Addons ). Card Gateway Routing Updates \u00b6 To create supplementary conditions in the routing schemes, we added two new attributes: Original Token (in case of recurrent payment flow) Payment Flow (as a follow-up to the previous update ) You may also notice We added delayed_charge value for Payment Flow attribute, but so far it is just a spoiler for future betterments. Commerce Update \u00b6 Minor renewal for payout users: we changed default attempts limit for processing from 5 to 0, in both separate and batch payouts options. This change does not affect already configured accounts, but we recommend to check the settings if you used to make payouts with the default value before (just so we are clear).

Structuring P2P Routing Strategies \u00b6 If you choose using P2P firstly option, you prioritise P2P routes in payout schemes. But if you have more than one p2p routes in the scheme, to select between them, the strategy is applied according to the current rules. Process Pending Payments \u00b6 If you have pending transactions due to provider technical failures or something, you can retry their processing from the dashboard. Please note This command does not automatically assign the transaction a successful status, but only puts it in the queue for re-processing. Custom Favicons for HPP \u00b6 From now on, you can customise one more small but significant element in your HPP theme. To replace default icon by your one, use favicon as key and a link (in the URL format, such as https://... ) as a value in the Theme options .

We take our clients' requests seriously, especially when it comes to updating our product. So, let us provide insight into what we've been developing inspired by your needs and wishes. Highlights \u00b6 Payout Schemes : improved payout routing Tokenisation process upgrade : separated two types of tokens Updates for Commerce account management : functionalities for archiving accounts and for setting up different Return URLs from the dashboard; also, updated Merchant Portal settings Dashboard UX Betterment : a full-text search launch HPP Update : change localisation key Bug Fixes List of Changes \u00b6 Payout Schemes \u00b6 We are gradually improving our approaches to transactions' routing. In the new version, we have significantly extended the functionality of the payout routing scheme and created a new component named the Payout Scheme . Find a new tool in the Payout Gateway section. The benefits of the Payout Schemes' implementation are: improved routing and fine-tune managing of route selection the possibility to configure a backup processing plan with the strategy cascade and the possibility to create the scheme of blockages that allows rejection of payouts based on transaction attributes Please note The Payout Schemes have the test_mode parameter. So that to test and then use them, you need to create both\u2014test and live\u2014schemes (pay attention to the mode change toggle). Tokenisation Process Upgrade \u00b6 And another internal improvement: we separate two types of tokens. Now we have public tokens for using in the Checkout process with the Remember me option\u2014and private tokens for card predefining and write-offs. This update does not affect the integration processes for our clients but allows us to speed up the interaction between the platform components. Updates for Commerce Account Management \u00b6 Archiving Accounts \u00b6 Our dev team cleaned up the Commerce section and added functionality for archiving accounts that already not in use. Their data is stored in a separate tab, and you can always find, view and unarchive them if necessary. Setup of Different Return URLs \u00b6 As an extension for this API update , we have added a relevant block to the integration options. And you can find the same options on the Merchant Portal when the New Payment is creating. They are automatically filled in according to the Commerce account settings, but you can modify their value in invoice. Update Settings for Merchant Portal \u00b6 We analysed the use of settings for Merchant portal creation, then streamlined the existing and also added some new ones, in particular parameters for custom API URLs and legal documents. Dashboard UX Betterment \u00b6 We launched a full-text search and updated the database so that all newer and older transaction data are presently available for search. HPP Update \u00b6 If you customise our Hosted Payment Page, pay your attention to localisation parameter: we have replaced its key language by locale . In so doing, its value remained the same: you need to use the ISO 639-1 code of one of the predefined languages. Bug Fixes \u00b6 We are polishing up our platform now, so it's not surprising that we find a lot of tiny things that can be developed or fixed. And thank our clients for help in these improvements!

These notes provide a brief overview of the new features, enhancements, and other significant changes introduced in the release 1.14 of our platform. Highlights \u00b6 Commerce Enhancements : added possibility to withhold part of the funds before releasing to the merchant and to include the minimum required balance for the currency account; restrictions on transfers between commerce accounts, and resolutions related to payout schemes usage Merchant Application update : added custom roles to account settings and the session limit to Merchant Portal configuration Card Gate Update : added metadata modifier; a cap limit increase to 100,000 UAH for payouts; bank transfers can be used for manual payouts And other minor performance improvements List of Changes \u00b6 Commerce Enhancements \u00b6 Rolling Reserve \u00b6 What is a Rolling Reserve ? A rolling reserve is a type of reserves that withholds a small percentage of all of a merchant\u2019s gross sales in a non-interest-bearing account for a predetermined amount of time before releasing the funds to the merchant. Payment processors may use rolling reserves as a risk management tactic for high-risk merchant accounts. You can set up the reserve rate (in percentage) and continuance (in minutes) for every commerce payment service you use. After turning-on reserve, these services are marked with a clock icon in the service scheme's list. Move the mouse over the icon to see a tooltip about percentage and expiry date of reservation. When we have carried out transactions using the service with rolling reserve included, the reservation data is displayed in the General overview of the corresponding payment invoice. You also can unreserve the funds manually before the expiry of the reservation. Click on the Actions button to unwrap the sub-menu and find the function. Minimal Required Balance \u00b6 The Minimal Required Balance ( MRB ) is a reserve that cannot be taken out from the Merchant Portal . MRB can be extra saves for your merchant funds in the relevant currency. To use, you should set it for each currency account separately in Commerce \u2192 Currency accounts settings. If MRB is set or become after manual withdrawals higher than the active account balance, the amount will be highlighted in red. Transfers between Commerce Accounts \u00b6 Merchants can operate with fund transfers between their accounts. And to fully use this option, you should specify accounts for transfers 'from' and 'to' defined commerce accounts in the Commerce settings. When enabled, these accounts will be displayed as available for transfers in the Merchant Portal. Status Resolutions Related to Payout Schemes \u00b6 We have also added additional types of payout request's failed status resolutions related to payout schemes usage: STRATEGY_RECEIVED_NO_ROUTES \u2014 there are no routes by the condition in the routing STRATEGY_CONFIGURED_ROUTES_WERE_FILTERED \u2014 all rows do not match a result of filtration NO_AVAILABLE_P2P_PAYMENTS \u2014 there are no proper p2p-payments (for \u04402\u0440-routes only) Test routing and handle resolutions as hints for setting up Payout Schemes. Merchant Application Settings Update \u00b6 Merchant portal administrators now have the opportunity to create new roles for their account users based on the existing ones. And in the basic configurations of the Merchant Portal , now you can set the time limit for user sessions (15 minutes by default). Card Gate Update \u00b6 We added Metadata attribute to payment scheme modifiers. So now you can use any of the metadata keys to determine payment invoice and enable or disable CVV and 3DS checks. Info If you make payouts to payment cards in Ukrainian hryvnias, we just want you to know about a cap limit raise up to 100,000 UAH. From now on, you can also use the Manual connector for bank transfer payouts. Performance Improvements \u00b6 Hope you notice an increase in the platform's productivity because we're continuously polishing our products for you.

Today\u2019s post features all the updates and enhancements you can find in our last update. Highlights \u00b6 The Refund Fee option : added possibility to return refund fee Payout Gateway Updates : added a routing condition by Metadata, limited payout splitting to 100 parts Card Gate Improvements : put to the general overview all connected features for the Merchant account, added new attributes for payment and payout routings, failover routing for same cards in case of auto-repeatable resolutions HPP Theme Options : increased limit up to 20 Reports Update : added Reserved amounts and Reserved balances Bug Fixes List of Changes \u00b6 Refund Fee Option \u00b6 Commerce accounts have a new option related to the refund process. Earlier, when you approved a refund request, the payment fee was withheld in any case and not returned to the account. Now our clients as providers can decide whether to cover the fee themselves or to pass it on to the consumer (the determination usually depends on the credibility of merchants, typical situations and reasons for the requests). This option is not yet available in the Commerce settings from the Dashboard. Please contact our support team to customise it. Payout Gateway Updates \u00b6 We added a routing condition by Metadata to Payout Schemes in line with Payment Routing Schemes . Also, please take into account that the Payout can now be split into a maximum of 100 parts . We imposed this restriction to prevent situations where payments are split too small to meet the conditions set by some route. Card Gate Improvements \u00b6 Now you can view all connected features for the Merchant account in the General overview. This is especially convenient for accounts connected long ago whose a list of features are already forgotten a bit. We revised currently used card parameters and, accordingly, added new attributes for payment and payout routings . And now you can set up routes depending on a global card system or network (such as Visa, Mastercard, Cirrus), a card brand (such as Standard, Gold, or World), and a card type (debit, credit, prepaid). Failover routing allows us to route payments if an error occurs on the way from a provider to an issuer. We have further improved the process; and now, when the card payment process fails with one of the auto-repeatable resolutions (such as access_denied , card_type_not_supported , or fatal_timeout ), we send payment to retry but filter the route caused the error if the customer enters the same card data. Additional Checkout Theme Options \u00b6 Excellent news for our Hosted Payment Page users! From now on, you can customise your checkout process with more variables because HPP theme limit has been increased up to 20 options. Reports Update \u00b6 We added new columns for Reserved amounts and Reserved balances to the tables to make reports more informative. The update applies automatically to all reports created after July 10. Bug Fixes \u00b6 Our version 1.17 also contains bug fixes and different minor system improvements.

The attempt to create a Payment with such a card will be blocked by verifying before Routing, Cascading, Auto-repay, or Modifier checks, and the related Payment Request will receive the rejected status and card_verification_failed resolution. If you have a list of cards to block in your organisation scope, inform us so we can put the relevant statuses into the database. List of Changes \u00b6 Batch Payouts' Refactoring and Upgrade : added customer attributes to a single batch item Card Gateway Update : added the possibility to share tokens for the Remember me option between your commerce accounts, and transliteration for the Cardholder DTO Minor API Scheme Update : added the Response URLs object New Functionality : addon for registration of financial transactions in the National Bank of Ukraine Minor bug fixes In the Details \u00b6 Batch Payouts' Upgrade \u00b6 We have heeded your wishes to improve the batch payout tool, made massive refactoring, and added new attributes for a single item in the batch. Now you can add a customer and a customer_metadata objects to link your payments to the already entered clients' data, update them, or create a new entry. Enter all objects' attributes separated by a semicolon (;). But keep in mind that in such case, the customer reference ID is mandatory to be specified. Batch Example Card Gate Update \u00b6 Suppose you have several Commerce accounts and use Remember me option on their checkout pages. In that case, you'll probably need the possibility to have a common database for tokens and to share tokens between these accounts. So you make it easier for your clients to fill out payment forms on your websites. Notice This option is only available to accounts managed by the same organisation. Send us your request, and we set it up for you. Also, we patched an issue with setting the Cyrillic cardholder names and added the transliteration algorithm to convert them to Latin. It won't cause you any more trouble with names recognising! API Update \u00b6 We have made a minor update to the scheme, and now API returns the Return URLs object in responses and callbacks (if it is not set, returns with null values). Callback Example New Addon \u00b6 We continue working on tailor-made solutions for your needs . According to the requirements of the financial monitoring procedure, Ukrainian merchants are required to register all their transactions with the National Bank of Ukraine. So, our dev team has prepared the addon for registration and reporting of financial transactions and status to the NBU through licensed institutions. Now it supports the registration as merchants and terminals of City24.ua (for Payments and Payouts) and FlashPay (Payments), but the list of registrars can be expanded soon.

In the Details \u00b6 Card Gateway Betterments \u00b6 Original Credit Transaction Flow \u00b6 From now on, we supported the OCT (Original Credit Transaction) flow for card payments. It is mainly applicable to refunding but not dependent on the amount of the initial payment. As follows, OCT flow is invoked in the context of a three-method sequence: funds are debited from a sender's account \u2192 then credited to a recipient's account \u2192 and, optionally, pushed back to the sender's account (for example, when the OCT authorization is declined). MCC and Merchant URL options \u00b6 We attached new features to the card gateway options for commerce accounts: MCC ( Merchant category code ) and Merchant URL. These data delivery is required by several global providers as additional payment verification. Thus, Merchant URL may coincide with the Website URL in the Commerce general profile but unlike it, cannot be changed by merchants via Merchant Portal. Forbid displaying previously saved card numbers \u00b6 To the request for API invoice creation, we added the restrict_saved_cards boolean parameter to the gateway_options \u2192 cardgate object ( false by default).

Highlights \u00b6 Card Gate update : added the browser_info object to the API for H2H connections Update of Receipt Addon : added new types of extensions for EDS keys Several bug fixes In the Details \u00b6 Card Gate Update \u00b6 During the Host-to-Host payment connection, now you have an option to transfer data about the user browser and device to meet 3DS protocol requirements. You can add all necessary parameters as optional properties of the browser_info object at the Payment sale stage. Request Example { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"sale-operation\" , \"attributes\" : { \"card_number\" : \"5519283812030000\" , \"card_holder\" : \"Card Holder\" , \"cvv\" : \"123\" , \"exp_month\" : \"10\" , \"exp_year\" : \"35\" , \"browser_info\" : { \"browser_tz\" : \"-60\" , \"browser_screen_width\" : \"1920\" } } } } Possible properties of the browser_info object Property Type Description Example browser_accept_header string HTTP accept headers as sent by the browser application/json, text/plain, */ browser_color_depth string Browser color depth 24 browser_ip string IP address returned by the browser 123.123.12.1 browser_java_enabled boolean Whether the browser can execute Java false browser_language string Browser language (ISO code) en-US browser_screen_height string Total height of the customer's screen in pixels 1200 browser_screen_width string Total width of the customer's screen in pixels 1920 browser_tz string Time difference between UTC time and the customer's browser local time, in minutes -120 browser_user_agent string Exact content of the HTTP user-agent header sent by the browser Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.135 Safari/537.36 device_channel string Device channel ID 02 window_height string Height of the customer's browser window in pixels 1200 window_width string Width of the customer's browser window in pixels 1920 Receipt Addon \u00b6 We continue developing and upgrading our addons, so, among others, we have already got the first feedback about the Receipt Addon that allows us to move forward and find new solutions to improve the product. The Receipt Addon is designed to generate the receipt files for the processed transactions, and now we expanded its functionality by adding new types of extensions for EDS Key. Therefore, the users can upload keys with Key-6.dat, *.pfx, *.pk8, *.zs2, or *.jks extensions and sign receipts with their own qualified electronic signature. Integration Update \u00b6 We should also highlight the added common standard scheme for transferring cardholder name parameter to the list of connectors. It is realised in the next sequence: If there is a saved card_holder parameter in the request or in the card vault, it is transferred unchanged. If no\u2014we check the customer object and set the name . And in all other cases, transfer the parameter with the default value CARD HOLDER . Bug Fixes \u00b6 We also fixed some irritative bugs, and hopefully, you can mention boosting of the platform's productivity!

Highlights \u00b6 Card Gate Updates : add Masterpass and possibility to customize currency exchange Data Export : exports for Deposits, Withdrawals and Transfers Layout Upgrade : added quick search for accounts Performance improvements List of Changes \u00b6 Card Gate Updates \u00b6 Right behind ApplePay and GooglePay, we added Masterpass payment feature! To enable it, click ' New Connection ' and choose the preferred payment provider. Then select masterpass from the feature list. Don't forget to reconnect Card Gate connections with right currencies and toggle Masterpass feature in the payment schemes. Also, did you notice another new feature in the previous screenshot? From now on, we can eliminate double loss due to bank fees on currency exchange by enabling this option. If the currency of the customer's card does not match the currency of the invoice, we check them and exchange invoice amount according to the chosen rate scheme in the relevant commerce account. But pay attention when the feature is allowed, the important thing is to control applying of FXrates schemes. Data Export \u00b6 We added tools for exporting data for Deposits, Withdrawals, and Transfers. It works the same as for Payment and Payout Invoices , and you can find it on Transactions tabs. Layout Upgrade \u00b6 If you are a team member of more than five organisations and often need to switch them, you'll appreciate this minor improvement. To search quickly for the right account name, just start typing in the drop-down. Performance Improvements \u00b6 This release is packed with updates but not bugs, and that is our minor triumph.
