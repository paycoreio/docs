*By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer*

Happy Friday [the 13th] mood from [PayCore.io](http://paycore.io/)!

We don't believe in superstitions and hope you don't, either. Because we have so many things to celebrate today! It's Programmers' Day, and my own Birthday, and certainly the fresh release of the platform. So hurray for **version 1.0**!

We can name [PayCore.io](http://paycore.io/) a stable product in the continuous growth stage now. Inevitably, there will be less of some epic modifications and feature updates but our dev team is focusing on core streamlining and system improvement.
