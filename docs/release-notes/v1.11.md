Cheery Greetings from PayCore.io!

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread, and we have an increased awareness of our responsibility to our employees, clients, and partners. We try to meet the challenges of the global pandemic implications head-on, take care of the health and safety of our employees and their families, and to minimize the impact of the financial pressure on our customers.

And of course, we do not stop improving our product. Welcome to version 1.11!

## List of Changes

### Addons

In a broad sense, an addon is a utility that enhances primary functionality. And PayCore.io addons are tailored solutions developed to meet the needs of our customers. That allows us to introduce the  necessary but narrowly focused features without interfering product architecture.

Decisions on whether to implement addons are made individually with each client. After implementation, you can find a list of all enabled addons and general information about them and linked accounts in the provider hub section (*Connected Accounts* --> *Addons*).

### Card Gateway Routing Updates

To create supplementary conditions in the routing schemes, we added two new attributes:

* Original Token (in case of recurrent payment flow)

* Payment Flow (as a follow-up to [the previous update](/release-notes/v1.10/#verify-flow))

??? note "You may also notice"
    We added `delayed_charge` value for Payment Flow attribute, but so far it is just a spoiler for future betterments.

### Commerce Update

Minor renewal for payout users: we change default attempts limit for processing from 5 to 0, in both separate and batch payouts options.

This change does not affect already configured accounts, but we recommend to check the settings if you used to make payouts with the default value before (just so we are clear).
