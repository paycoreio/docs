# **PayCore.io v1.5.16 (December 27, 2019)**

*By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer*

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, friends! Hoping your holidays—and all the days of 2020—are filled with joy!

Cheery Season's greetings from [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/)!

This year we have done much, and more is needed. The platform is growing as a product: it became a versatile payment hub. Our team continues the system development and preparing an extensive rebuild for [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/).  We should recognize that the journey has just begun, but we are encouraged by the results of the work done so far.

## Highlights

* [Creation of the Merchant Portal](#merchant-portal-tab): internal logic update
* [New integrations](#new-integrations): Wirecard, Forward Bank, a bunch of refunds' update
* [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)

## List of Changes

### Merchant Portal Tab

We boosted up the process of linking the merchant application with the main dashboard.  It was necessary to update the internal logic of App's creation, but no need to worry: nothing has changed radically from outside.

Thus, if you need to create a Commerce Account linked with an application, you can set up its start parameters via [the Merchant Portal tab in the Administration section](https://dashboard.paycore.io/administration/merchant-portal).

### Performance Improvements

This week we also made a handful of insignificant bug fixes too small for the human eye.

The holiday season approached, so the next issue of release notes is scheduled on Friday, January 10.  Let's enjoy this wintertime!
