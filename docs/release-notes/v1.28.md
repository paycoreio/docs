Cheerful Greetings from [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/)!

We start our 2021 with routing and processing updates, so in these brief notes, you can look through the most relevant of them.

But firstly, the important news:

!!! info "Be aware"
    From February 2, 2021, we start to send in the Callbacks an additional parameter `auth_type`. Thus, it allows identifying which flow the transaction was managed by.

    This will not affect existing integrations, but if you want to obtain information about the authentication types, you should add the relevant parameter to your Callback handlers.
