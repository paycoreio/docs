## In the Details

### Commerce Update

As a follow-up for the [previous update](/release-notes/v1.17/#refund-fee-option), we added the *Return fee on the refund* option to the *Commerce Accounts Settings* --> *Payment options*.

### Card Gate Update

We discovered the problem when a user attempted to make a card payment with the card requisites restricted by the provider for some reasons (such as an unwelcome currency or country of origin) but had no error messages with payment resolutions. This happened because the transaction was rejected at the Payment Request level with the types of resolution similar to `no_routes_by_condition`.

And now, in this case, the user not only receives an error message but returns to the payment page with a suggestion to try another card for payment.
