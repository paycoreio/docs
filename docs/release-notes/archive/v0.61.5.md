## All Updates

### Commerce upgrade

We improved the usability of our platform. Last upgrades are connected with both PayCore Dashboard and Merchant portal: we have increased opportunities for searching through payment and payouts operations. Now you have an expanded set of filters and can combine them for the most accurate result.

Do you familiar with our batching payouts service?  It is purposed for sending a high number of payouts in a few mouse clicks.

And if you find it useful, you ought to know that we changed the location of its Options block. From now, block was moved into Commerce settings, so you no longer need to set up them every time you send the batchâ€”only have to get it right once.
