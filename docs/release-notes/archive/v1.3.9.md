We continue working on system enhancements, and these are short notes about our updates and improvements.

## All Updates

### System UX Betterment

From here on out, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments are identified in a separate tab in the payments' grids.

What is peer-to-peer payment? Money transfer from sender's card to the card, phone number or account of the recipient. P2P payments are all about ease-of-use, convenience, and speed: to send money, users need to make a few clicks. And will be cool to give them that opportunity.

To connect P2P account, don't forget to choose `p2p` feature from the dropdown:

We separated the *Payment requests*' grid, and it's easier now to look them up.

Also, navigating between routing schemes feels much better with the added search field:

### Card Gate Upgrades

Since then, you can find all *Payment invoices* in the first tab of the *Card Gate* section.

And the last, but not the least system reform: *Original provider code* is attached for card payment's data. Card Gate is still displayed as the main provider for the card payments, but you can find a transaction provider's code in the payment general info:

And search through all payments by this parameter too:
