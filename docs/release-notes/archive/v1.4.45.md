# **PayCore.io v1.4.45 (November 29, 2019)**

*By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer*

Happy Friday mood from [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/)!

We keep enhancing our products. This week the dev team focused on boosting productivity and payment safety and worked on the deep-seated modifications for our products and platform features. Mostly, these enhancements are under the hood, so the release notes are not filled up by updates. But we planned a lot of changes in the nearest time.
