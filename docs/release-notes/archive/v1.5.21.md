Happy Friday mood from [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/)!

There are the first release notes in the 2020s! Are you ready for the new decade? We're looking forward to new opportunities and development attitudes!

And we are back on track and continue working on our platform growth.

## Highlights

* [Payouts' moderation upgrade](#payouts-moderation-upgrade): added possibility to moderate payouts directly from the dashboard
* [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)

### Payouts' Moderation Upgrade

We added a button to the *General payout overview* in the *Payout Gateway* section. Just find an entity for the payout that is required moderation and select the right option.
