Season's Greetings from the [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/) team!

This page includes only the new features and product improvements released in the recent two weeks. But all year long, we have worked hard to ensure our products are continually improving to make handling your payment processes more efficient and convenient.

We have done much, but much more is needed to grow and widen our horizons.

## Highlights

* [Increased Metadata limit](#metadata-update) up to 20 attributes
* [Batch Payouts Validation Update](#batch-payouts-update): the limit number of Base64 characters must not exceed 100,000 in the whole file
* [Card Gate Update](#card-gateway-update): sanitised Cardholder DTO
* [Integration Updates](#integration-updates): CoinsPaid, CrossPay, Genome, Ibox Bank, Odysseq, Stripe, xpate; PHP currency
* [And other minor fixes and performance improvements](#fixes-and-improvements)

## In the Details

### Metadata Update

The Metadata object is heavily used to transfer additional transaction data so fulfilling our clients' requests, we increased its attributes' limit **up to 20**.

### Batch Payouts Update

As a follow-up to the previous [batch payouts' update](/release-notes/v1.22/#batch-payouts-upgrade), we have revised the validation approach because adding new fields made transaction carrying complicated. We check each payout row separately according to provider settings and validate that the limit number of Base64 characters does not exceed **100,000** in the whole batch file.

### Card Gateway Update

Emoji in the cardholder name field? No longer an issue!

We sanitised Cardholder DTO so you can see in the Invoice and the database fields all the ðŸ’• and ðŸ˜‰ that the user put in, and the provider receives in Payment Latin symbols not caused an error.

### Fixes and Improvements

Stay in touch and have a magical Holiday season, friends!
