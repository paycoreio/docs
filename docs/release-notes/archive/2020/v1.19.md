Cheery Autumn Greetings from [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/)!

We're continually working on our products getting better. And we are inspired to share the latest improvements with you!

## This Update includes

* [Commerce Update](#commerce-update): allowed controlling the refund fee option from the Dashboard
* [Card Gate Update](#card-gate-update): added the error message with a hint for payment retry (in case of "bad" routing)
* [Trivial Bug Fixes](#bug-fixes)

## In the Details

### Commerce Update

As a follow-up for the [previous update](/release-notes/v1.17/#refund-fee-option), we added the *Return fee on the refund* option to the *Commerce Accounts Settings* --> *Payment options*.

### Card Gate Update

We discovered the problem when a user attempted to make a card payment with the card requisites restricted by the provider for some reasons (such as an unwelcome currency or country of origin) but had no error messages with payment resolutions. This happened because the transaction was rejected at the Payment Request level with the types of resolution similar to `no_routes_by_condition`.

Now the user receives an error message with a hint to return and try to use another card for payment.

### Bug Fixes

The release 1.19 also features small bug fixes and updated platform components.

Stay tuned for the next updates!
