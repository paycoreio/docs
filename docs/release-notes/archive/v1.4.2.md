## All Changes

### HPP v2.0

The Hosted Payment Page (HPP) is a service that lets you use PayCore.io to accept payments without the need of integrating our products in your web pages, or even without having any website. If you are not familiar with its functions, you can [check the summary](https://paycore.io/payment-gateway/checkout/) or [read more information in our guides](../../products/hpp/).

Version 2.0 has significantly improved performance. We restructured it following best practices, made the HPP more customizable and boosted data processing.

### Dashboard UX Betterment

![New Filters](images/v1.4.1/filters.png)

We reorganized the system of filters in all sections of dashboard: added new and got rid of useless.

Hope, now they are much more helpful for searching desired entries.

### Card Gate Enhancements

#### Modifiers for routing schemes

![Modifier Scheme](images/v1.4.1/modifier-scheme.png)

Card Gate routing schemes have a new functionality: you can add new rules connected with Modifiers such as 3D-Secure and required CVV (we intend to expand the list of conditions and modifiers later).

#### Pull statements option

![Pull Statements](images/v1.4.1/pull-statement.png)

From now on, you can manually pull statements and re-upload Card Gate transaction status and resolution.

#### Payments to the tokenized card

We added the possibility to create payments by a token instead of the card number. Rules for creating request are the same as [for payouts request](../v1.3.21/#payouts-with-the-tokenized-card).
