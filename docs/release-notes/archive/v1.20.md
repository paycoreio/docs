## In the Details

### Merchant App Theme Switcher

Good news for those who are tired of the strict laconic but standard design of our merchant application! If you have at least one custom theme created, you can change them in the portal settings.

Save the changes and please your users with a new appearance of the Merchant portal.

    Send us your request, and together we find the best design solution!

### Card Gate Update

We added a new attribute for Card Gate payment schemes: routing by the Client IPs. So you can set conditions for one, several or a group of IP addresses.

### Reports and Exports Upgrades

If a report generation option is enabled for the account, now you can also create and download a report for an optional period. Open *Reports* section, click the *+New Report* button and choose a type of report to create.
