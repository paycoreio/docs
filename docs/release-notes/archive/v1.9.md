The Amount Multiplier is a factor that helps to optimize your interaction with PSPs. It allows modifying the amount shown to a customer at the provider's checkout and increasing or decreasing this amount depends on fee strategy.

FlashPay parameter may be useful for our Ukrainian partners. It allows us to link the merchant account with the account in FlashPay and synchronize reporting to the National Bank (more domestic systems are coming soon).

### Update Payout Routes
