## All Updates

### Cascading Launch

One of the key features of Smart Routing has been launch for testing! 

Cascading is the technology that supports executing transactions through the alternative gateway if the primary channel is unavailable. The process is invisible to your customers but helps guarantee a higher success rate in processing payments and better revenue stream. It also protects your transactions loss because of a disruption to the acquirer services.

So we're all excited to introduce Cascading to reroute your payments and payouts in cases of declined transactions and provider inaccessibility.

### Ledger Betterment

We know that for the users, the ledger is the most puzzling section of the platform. But it is a vital part of the process, and we put a lot of effort into performance improvements and enhancing the links inside the system.

*As a soft reminder to our customers, Ledger screen is available on PayCore.io Commerce plan*. And after the activation, you can organise debit and credit accounts to suit your needs better for accounting and financial management.
