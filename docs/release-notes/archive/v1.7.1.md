## List of Changes

### Commerce Update

As the subsequent update to the [Tokenization feature](/release-notes/v1.3.17/#card-data-tokenization), we added a relevant property to the general payments options. So you can turn on it for all card payments to the chosen Commerce account, avoiding your having to check every creating invoice.

### Layout Upgrade

#### Logs in Transactions

From now on, you can check interaction with merchant back-end applications and view details of sent requests and responses in the Logs list. Find this possibility in the Transactions' overviews.

#### New Filter for Payouts

If you need to search quickly all payout invoices for the specified payee, use a new filter. You can examine all possible payout details, such as card or phone numbers, account IDs, and so on.
