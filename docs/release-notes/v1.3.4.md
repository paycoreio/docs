## All Updates

### Data Export

We added tools for exporting data for Payment and Payout Invoices . Find this option in the [*Operations*](https://dashboard.paycore.io/operations/payment-invoices) section.

Firstly, filter the appropriate transactions and then export them in .csv or .xlsx formats. You can use and combine any filters of your choice. Just remember that test data are available only in the test mode and vice versa, for the live transactions.

Preparatory actions take some time and thus export entry is opened in the new tab. Click on the link in a pop-up to take you to the on-going entry or find data about all exports' requests [there](https://dashboard.paycore.io/data-exports/list).
