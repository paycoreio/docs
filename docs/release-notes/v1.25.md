## In the Details

### Card Gate Update

During the Host-to-Host payment connection, now you have an option to transfer data about the user browser and device to meet 3DS protocol requirements. You can add all necessary parameters as optional properties of the **`browser_info`** object  at the Payment sale stage.

        {
        "data": {

                    }
                }

        ```

### Receipt Addon

We continue developing and upgrading our addons, so, among others, we have already got the first feedback about the Receipt Addon that allows us to move forward and find new solutions to improve the product.

The Receipt Addon is designed to generate the receipt files for the processed transactions, and now we expanded its functionality by adding new types of extensions for EDS Key. Therefore, the users can upload keys with Key-6.dat, *.pfx, *.pk8, *.zs2, or *.jks extensions and sign receipts with their own qualified electronic signature.

### New and Updated Integrations

| Provider | Name  | New features |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| <img src="https://static.openfintech.io/payment_providers/alfabank/logo.svg?w=70" width="70px">  | [AlfaBank](/connectors/alfabank/) | SOAP Flow (MOTO payments & quick reconciliation), REST Customer Data configuration update  |
| <img src="https://static.openfintech.io/payment_providers/cib/logo.svg?w=70" width="70px">  | [ComIn Bank](/connectors/cib/) | H2H payment connection, Payouts, Account balances  |
| <img src="https://static.openfintech.io/payment_providers/forwardbank/logo.svg?w=70" width="70px">      | [Forward Bank](/connectors/forwardbank/)  | 3DS 2.0 and failover for 3DS 1.0  |
| <img src="https://static.openfintech.io/payment_providers/safecharge/logo.png?w=70" width="70px"> | [SafeCharge](/connectors/safecharge/) | 3DS 2.0 and 3DS 1.0 update |

Besides, we added the `{city}` field to the dynamic descriptor for the [Procard](/connectors/procard/) connection.

#### Card Holder Data Transfer

We should also highlight the added common standard scheme for transferring cardholder parameter for transferring cardholder name data to the following connectors:

* [AlfaBank](/connectors/alfabank/)
* [Connectum](/connectors/connectum/)
* [Cypix](/connectors/cypix/)
* [Decta](/connectors/decta/)
* [Exactly](/connectors/safecharge/)
* [Paybox](/connectors/paybox/)
* [Piastrix](/connectors/piastrix/)
* [Platio](/connectors/platio/)
* [RBKmoney](/connectors/rbkmoney)
* [RoyalPay](/connectors/royalpay/)
* [WinPay](/connectors/winpay/)
* [Wirecard](/connectors/wirecard/)
* [Wlandpay](/connectors/wlandpay/)
* [Xpate](/connectors/xpate/)

It is realised in the next sequence:

1. If there is a saved `card_holder` parameter in the request or in the card value, it is transferred unchanged.
2. If no—we check the `customer` object and set the `name`.
3. And in all other cases, transfer the parameter with the default value `CARD HOLDER`.

### Bug Fixes

We also fixed some irritative bugs, and hopefully, you can mention boosting of the platform's productivity!

Stay tuned for the next updates!
