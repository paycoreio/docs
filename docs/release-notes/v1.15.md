## List of Changes

### Platform UX Enhancements

#### The Payload for Deposit Account Balances

We added the possibility to obtain the payload for *Deposit account* balances. So now, if your provider sends additional information with the balance statistics, you can find it in the appropriate section: *Connected accounts* --> [*Deposit accounts*](https://dashboard.paycore.io/provider-hub/deposit-accounts).

#### Extra Fields in the Payout Overview

We have attached extra fields to the Payout Overview. They display all the service parameters specified when an invoice was created.

#### Sort Records by Created

Now the sections have an additional parameter to sort the entries by creation date. Hope, users can navigate the records more convenient now.

#### P2P Actions

Now you have the opportunity to prioritize payment processing directly in the invoice list. After filtering by strategies, payments will be accepted for processing according to the set priority (for this, the value of priority should be higher than 0).

You can also use this menu to send payments for manual moderation.

#### Additional Fields for Data Grid

Also, we boosted up data export and added Commerce Account ID (`com_acc_id`) and Commerce Account Name (`com_acc_name`) to the data grid in the *Deposits*, *Withdrawals*, and *Transfers* sections.

### Merchant Application Update

In extension to the [previous update](/release-notes/v1.14/#merchant-application-settings-update), we also added the API key selector to the basic configuration. The selector displays description labels of the actual existent keys.
