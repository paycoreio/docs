#### Deprecates

The **Payment Page** and **Payout Point** have been deprecated. 

We've disabled these features for the new signups and the features will be removed for existing accounts in a future update to v 1.0. 

The deprecation period for these changes began on **01 June 2019**. Please contact our technical support to provide you with a migration path to the new REST APIs.

Using SQL queries you can extract information from your database for incoming and outgoing invoices and batch payouts, commerce schemes, commerce account balances, as well as the other entities, were previously supported.
