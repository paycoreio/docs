### Payout operation
This operation is responsible for communication with external provider. It is the low level operation that responsible for status mapping, processed amount calculation.

### Payout request operation 
This operation has many features that make payout processing simpler:
1. Exchange rates
1. Failover
1. Splitting 
 
It creates payout operation under the hood during processing. 

### Create first payout request
