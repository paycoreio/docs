Dashboards can be grouped with **```#hashtags```**. You simply add the **```#hashtags```** to the dashboard name. All currently used **```#hashtags```** will appear on the dashboards page left pane.
You can click on any of the tags to show all dashboards with this tag or Shift+Click on multiple tags to show dashboards that use all selected tags together.
