# Organization Account

## Introduction

A  **organization**  in {{custom.company_name}} can be visualized as a container that holds all the customer information, payment provider accounts, payment & payout data, reports and associated configurations. It's the heart of a {{custom.company_name}} account and the way it is built and configured determines how your customers are paid, charged and communicated with. The kind of access privileges you have on a organization depend on the kind of  **role**  you have as a organization  **member**. You can learn more about organization member roles  [here](/account/assess-control/). The top-left corner in {{custom.company_name}} shows the organization you are working in and allows you to switch to any other one you may have access to.


## Organisation settings

In these cases "Organisation settings" is structurally divided into 3 sections:

1. [General](general)

2. [Security](security)

3. [Access control](access)
