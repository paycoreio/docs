## Introduction

## Customer Subscriptions

Customers are the basis for your subscriptions. They work seamlessly in conjunction with subscriptions. Under the hood, its the customer entry which contains vital information about a subscription, such as – credit card information and email address. PayCore.io uses the information stored in the customer record to create a subscription.

A customer may subscribe to several products. In this case, there will be one customer entry that will display multiple subscriptions, when the same exact customer entry is used across many subscriptions.

It’s important to note that under normal circumstances you won’t need to add a customer directly to this area. Additionally, you can search through your customers via email, organization and reference.

Other attributes such as  tax exempt status  and VAT numbers are included in the customer entry in PayCore.io, as well.
