### 2FA

**Two-factor authentication** (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two means of identification before accessing an [account](#account).

The two levels of security are a password and a unique special code generated by an authentication app installed on a mobile device. 

!!! tip
    Popular authentication apps' examples are *Google Authenticator* and *Authy*.

If 2FA is enabled, a [user](#user) receives a temporary 6-digit code which can be used only for a very short period: about 20 seconds. After 20 seconds the code will expire and a new code will be generated. The requirement to enter both the password and this 6-digit code makes an account better protected. Even if the password is compromised (make sure to never reveal it to anyone!), the account cannot be accessed without direct access to the mobile device.

Enable 2FA in account preferences &rarr; *User profile settings*.

### 3D Secure

**Three-Domain Secure** (3DS), also known as a payer authentication, is a security protocol that helps to prevent [fraud](#fraud) in online credit and debit card transactions. This additional security was initiated and created by Visa and MasterCard and it’s branded as ‘Verified by Visa’ and ‘MasterCard SecureCode’ respectively.

There are 4 main parties involved in the process: the customer (card owner), the issuer (such as Visa or MasterCard), the [acquirer (bank)](#acquiring-bank), and the interoperability domain (such as [payment system](#payment-service)).

!!! info 
    When you, as a merchant, have 3D Secure enabled on your website and your customer uses the card that is enrolled in the 3D Secure program, the process looks as follows:

    1. The customer enters their credit or debit card information in the payment form.
    2. Payment system contacts a directory server and gets the message that the card is registered in the program.
    3. The customer sees the 3D Secure page when they need to authenticate themselves to the [issuing bank](#issuing-bank) by entering the password or a one-time PIN.
    4. The result of the 3DS authentication goes to the payment system and then it submits transaction details to the acquirer.
    5. The transaction is authorized or denied by the acquirer.
    6. The customer can see the response about whether the transaction is successful or failed.

    Aside from managing all transactions that a cardholder completes with his or her credit or debit card, an acquirer also assumes full risk and responsibility associated with the transactions it processes. Because of this, the acquirer charges various fees for its services. These fees vary by the acquirer, but they're commonly assessed on a routine schedule for activities such as transactions, refunds, chargebacks, and other various situations and reasons.

The issuing bank or credit card company, as the last option can issue a credit to the customer, called a chargeback. Other reasons for a chargeback include bank processing errors, duplicate billing, identity theft, disputes over the price charged and processed, or missed refunds.

    Merchants may suffer heavy penalties for chargebacks. Chargeback processing is an expensive process for all parties involved, from the issuing bank to the acquiring banks, to the payment service provider, and the fees charged to the merchant for each chargeback often reflects that. The card associations have strict rules about chargeback management which they require banks, payment service providers, and merchants to follow. If a merchant receives too many chargebacks, it will no longer be permitted to accept credit cards from the card associations.
