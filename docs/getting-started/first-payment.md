# Create your first payment & payout


## Introduction

To execute payments and payouts, your account should be previously configured and have connected payment providers with active payment routes.

If you haven't set up your account yet, we recommend going to the ['Setting up'](/getting-started/setting-up-account/) article at first.

## Receiving your first payment

* **Step 1**. Go to ['Operations' → 'Payment invoices'](https://the {{custom.company_name}} Dashboardompany_name}}/operations/payment-invoices).
