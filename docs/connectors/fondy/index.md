Then, generate the Apple Pay certificate  by yourself, or apply to Fondy or {{custom.company_name}} support team for doing it for you.

1. Generate keys and CSR (Certificate Signing Requests)

    ??? example "The example sequence of console commands (for MacOs)"

        ``` bash
        openssl genrsa -out merchant.key 2048
        openssl ecparam -out apple_pay.key -name prime256v1 -genkey
        # Apple Pay Merchant Identity Certificate Request
        openssl req -new -key merchant.key -out merchant.csr
        # Apple Pay Payment Processing Certificate Request
        openssl req -new -sha256 -key apple_pay.key -nodes -out apple_pay.csr
        ```

2. Use the obtained CSR files to generate certificates to complete registration at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/merchant/add).

3. Get your CRT certificates and convert to .pem and .p12 format.

    ??? example "The example sequence of console commands (for MacOs)"

        ``` bash
        # DER to PEM
        openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -text -in merchant.cer -out merchant.pem
        openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -text -in apple_pay.cer -out apple_pay.pem

        # PEM to P12
        openssl pkcs12 -export -out apple_pay.p12 -inkey apple_pay.key -in apple_pay.pem
        openssl pkcs12 -export -out merchant.p12 -inkey merchant.key -in merchant.pem
        ```

At key generation step, you can additionally protect your certificates with a password.
