## [Self-hosted payment page](/products/hpp/self-hosted-payment-page/)

Before you can make a payment with our API integration, you need to collect any required payment details from your shopper. Here we describe how to do this by building your own payment form.
Building your own form gives you full control over the look and feel of your checkout. If you'd rather not build your own payment form, you can also collect the shopper's payment details using our pre-built JavaScript Components. These are available for many popular payment methods.

Build and host yourself using SDKs or client API:
