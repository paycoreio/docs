# Testing

Our sandbox environment provides an excellent opportunity to make sure everything is working perfectly. Use the information on this page to test your integration thoroughly before going live.

# Test keys

Always use your test keys when testing your integration, this is how we know to link all test payments to your sandbox account. You can find your test keys in our sandbox version of the  [Commerce](/products/commerce)  under your integration settings â€” test keys use the prefix  `sk_test`and  `pk_test`.
